Berthold Biermann (1905-1953) was a German Jewish journalist and statesman. In 1933, forced to go into exile because of his ancestry, Biermann and his wife moved to Paris, where he worked for a press run by German exiles. After splitting from his wife, Biermann moved to the United States, where he wrote on literature and politics to earn a living. Biermann moved back to Germany at the end of World War II, and committed suicide in 1953.
