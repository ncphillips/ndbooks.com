Mikhail Bulgakov (1891–1940) is best known in the west for his monumental novel _The Master and Margarita_. A writer who remained in Russia after the Revolution, he had continual difficulty with censorship, and by 1930 his work was barred from publication or production. It wasn’t until years after his death, in 1940, that _The Master and Margarita_ was finally published.
