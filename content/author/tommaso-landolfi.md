Tommaso Landolfi (1908–1979) was an Italian writer and translator. Born in Pico, in the province of Frosinone, Landolfi received a degree in Russian Literature from Florence University and translated several Russian works. His own work combined realism, speculative fiction and surrealism, and was often compared to the fictions of Kafka and Borges. He died in Rome.
