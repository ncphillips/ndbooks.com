Bohumil Hrabal (1914â€“1997) was born in Moravia and started writing poems under the influence of French surrealism. In the early 1950s, he began to experiment with a stream-of-consciousness style, and eventually wrote such classics as _Closely Watched Trains_ (made into an Academy Award-winning film directed by Jiri Menzel), _The Death of Mr. Baltisberger,_ and _Too Loud a Solitude._ He fell to his death from the fifth floor of a Prague hospital, apparently trying to feed the pigeons.
