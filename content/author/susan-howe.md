Author of more than a dozen books of poetry and two of literary criticism, Susan Howe's recent collection of poems _That This_, published by New Directions won the Bollingen Prize in 2011. Her earlier critical study, _My Emily Dickinson_, was re-issued in 2007with an introduction by Eliot Weinberger. Three CDs in collaboration with the musician/composer David Grubbs, _Thiefth_ and _Souls of the Labadie Tract_, and _Frolic Architecture._ were released on the Blue Chopsticks label (2005; 2011). Howe held the Samuel P. Capen Chair in Poetry and the Humanities at the State University New York at Buffalo until her retirement in 2007. The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999 and served as a Chancellor to the Academy of American Poets between 2000-2006. In fall, 2009 she was awarded a Fellowship to the American Academy at Berlin. Grenfell Press published a fine press edition of â€œFrolic Architecture with photographic prints by James Welling in 2009. Recently she was an Artist In Residence at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. In October, 2013 her word collages were exhibited at the Yale Union in Portland, Oregon, and in the Whitney Biennial Spring, 2014. A limited press edition of _Tom Tit Tot_ (the word collages which amount to a series poem) with art work by R.H. Quaytman has just been published by MoMA in New York, and _Spontaneous Particulars:The Telepathy of Archives_, (2014) published by Christine Burgin and New Directions.
