Born Rene Karl Wilhelm Johann Josef Maria Rilke (1875â€“1927), Rainer Maria Rilke was an influential German poet, novelist, and translator perhaps best known for _Duino Elegies_ and his prose piece _Letters to a Young Poet_. He married Clara Westhoff, a sculptress, in 1901. Although they were only together for a year, they had one daughter together. Rilke died of leukemia in Montreaux, Switzerland in 1927.
