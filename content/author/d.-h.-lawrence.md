Born in 1885, the sickly son of a Nottingham coal miner, David Herbert Lawrence led a nomadic life in Ceylon, Australia, the United States (New Mexico), and Mexico with his wife Frieda. His novels include _Sons and Lovers_ (1913), _Women in Love_ (1921), and the most controversial _Lady Chatterley’s Lover_ (1928, though banned in the US until 1959). His works also include volumes of stories, poems, literary criticism and essays, plays and travel books. He died of tuberculosis in 1930 at the age of forty-five.
