Joyce Cary (1888â€“1957), an Irish novelist often identified with Modernism, was born in Dery, Ireland but lived in England for most of his life. Cary studied art in Edinburgh but, realizing he would never be a great painter, switched to literature and enrolled in Trinity College, Oxford. The publication of Mister Johnson in 1939 brought him attention as an author. In 1952, Cary was diagnosed with motor neuron disease, which made it harder and harder for him to write. A trilogy was left unfinished when he passed away in 1957.
