William Herrick was born on January 10, 1915 in Trenton, New Jersey. As a young man he worked on an anarchist farm, lived in a commune in Michigan, hoboed around the country, and was very nearly tarred and feathered while organizing Black sharecroppers in the South. Returning to the North, he worked for the Furriersâ€™ Union in New York City and then traveled to Spain, where, as a member of the International Brigades, he fought for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War until he was wounded on the Madrid Front. Returning to New York, Herrick was employed for many years as a court reporter, only taking time off to work for Orson Welles for a short spell. He died in 2004.
