Jonathan Williams (1929–2008) was a poet, publisher and photographer from Scaly Mountain, North Carolina. As founder of the long-running poetry and arts journal, _The Jargon Society_, Williams published work from Charles Olson, Joel Oppenheimer and many other prominent poets of the avant-garde. Williams’s own poetry was highly unique, employing "found language" from Appalachia.
