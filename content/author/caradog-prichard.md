Caradog Prichard (1904â€“1980) was born in the slate-quarrying town of Bethesda, in northwest Wales. Pursuing journalism as a career, he trained at Caernarfon, before moving on to Cardiff and eventually London. After the Second World War he became a sub-editor on the foreign desk at the _Daily Telegraph_. During his time he wrote four prize-winning odes and _One Moonlit Night_. He remained in London until he died.
