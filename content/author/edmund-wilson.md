Edmund Wilson (1895–1972) was the most influential literary critic of his generation. He was managing editor of _Vanity Fair_, Associate Editor of _The New Republic_, and a book reviewer for _The New Yorker_ and the _New York Review of Books_. _Axel’s Castle_, his 1931 study of Symbolism, and _To the Finland Station_, a sweeping history of European socialism, are among his most highly-regarded titles.
