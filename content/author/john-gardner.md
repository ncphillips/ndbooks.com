John Gardner (1933-1982) was a popular and controversial author. He wrote several best-selling novels, including Grendel, The Sunlight Dialogues, Nickel Mountain, and October Light (which won the National Critics Circle Award in 1976), and The Art of Fiction, an essay text now standard in university writing classes, and On Moral Fiction, a book so scandalous it almost destroyed his career.
