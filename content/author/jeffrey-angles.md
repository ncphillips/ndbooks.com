Jeffrey Angles (1971- ) is a professor of Japanese and translation at Western Michigan University. He is the author of _Writing the Love of Boys_ (University of Minnesota Press, 2011) and _These Things Here and Now: Poetic Responses to the March 11, 2011 Disasters_ (Josai University, 2016). He is also the award-winning translator of dozens of Japan's most important modern Japanese authors and poets. He believes strongly in the role of translators as social activists, and much of his career has focused on the translation into English of socially engaged, feminist, or queer writers. He also writes poetry, mostly Japanese, his adopted second language. His collection _Hizuke henkō sen (International Date Line)_ will be published by Shichōsha in the near future.
