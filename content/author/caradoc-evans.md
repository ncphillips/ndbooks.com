Caradoc Evans (1878-1945) was a journalist, story-writer, playwright, and novelist. He became the most reviled man in Wales after My People, a collection of stories about life in rural west Wales, was published in 1915. He is now regarded as one of the outstanding narrative and satirical writers of his country, and is called "the Zola of the Valleys."
