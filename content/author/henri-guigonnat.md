French writer Henri Guigonnat, at the age of twenty-five, won the first-ever Prix de l'Insolite (Prize for the Unusual) from the town of Agde for his first and only novel, Daemon in Lithuania. An absurd and poetic story about an boy, a cat, and an alternate Lithuania, the book won him comparisons to Lewis Carrol, Jean Cocteau, and Voltaire, among others.
