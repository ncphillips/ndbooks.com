Raduan Nassar was born in 1935 in Pindorama, in the state of São Paolo, Brazil. _A Cup of Rage_ and _Ancient Tillage_ are his two major literary works. Raised in a Lebanese immigrant family, Nassar attended law school at the University of São Paolo and was a journalist and editor for the newspaper _Jornal de Bairro_. Although hailed around the world as a major writer, Nassar has led a private existence since 1985, dedicated to farming and livestock production.
