Frederick William Serafino Austin Lewis Mary Rolfe (1860-1913), better known as Baron Corvo, was a British novelist and short story writer. Rolfe spent a lot of his life working as a freelance writer, although for brief stints he served as professor at various universities and, in 1887, entered Oscott Seminary, intending to become a priest. He soon left the Seminary, enrolled in Scots College in Rome, but was expelled from there only a few years later. He passed away in 1913.
