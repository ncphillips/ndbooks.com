Lionel Trilling (1905–1975) was a literary critic and member of the New York Intellectuals, who set themselves apart from the New Critics by stressing the importance of a literary work’s sociopolitical circumstances. Born in Queens, New York, Trilling attended Columbia University, and maintained a lifelong relationship with the school. In addition to his criticism, Trilling wrote one novel and a few short stories.
