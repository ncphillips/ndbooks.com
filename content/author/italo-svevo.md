Italo Svevo (1861–1928) was an Italian-Jewish businessman who wrote novels, plays, and stories. Interested in Freudian theory, he wrote the novel _Confessions of Zeno,_ which caught the eye of James Joyce. Zeno, the novel’s protagonist, was an avatar for Svevo himself, who also served as a model for Leopold Bloom in Joyce’s Ulysses.
