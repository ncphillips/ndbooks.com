Madame de La Fayette (1634–1693) was born into a wealthy family of minor nobility in Paris. While being educated, she attended all of the fashionable salons of her day. In 1655, she married François Motier, comte de La Fayette, and later became acquainted with many of the major literary luminaries of the period, including Racine and Boileau.
