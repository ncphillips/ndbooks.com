Reiner Stach, born in 1951 in Saxony, is the author of the definitive biography of Kafka. The first two volumes, published here by Princeton University Press, received starred reviews from _Publishers Weekly_ ("superb"), _Library Journal_ ("a monumental accomplishment"), _Kirkus_ ("essential"), and _Booklist_ ("masterful").
