Few Cuban writers embodied the paradigm of frustration and brilliance of genius like Guillermo Rosales (Cuba, 1946 â€“ Miami, 1993). Although he destroyed most of his work before committing suicide, _The Halfway House_ survived and was published posthumously. A collection of short stories, _Leap Frog_, was published by New Directions in 2013.
