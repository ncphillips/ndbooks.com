Carlton Lake was the Paris art critic for _The Christian Science Monitor_. He also contributed to a number of American and European periodicals including _The New Yorker_ and _The Atlantic Monthly_—in which appeared, along with his short stories, essays, and conversations with such artists as Matisse, Picasso, Chagall, Henry Moore, and Giacometti. A renown collector of modern French art, literature, and music, Lake donated his collection to the Harold Ransom Center at the University of Austin (where he once held the position of director)—it can still be viewed there today.
