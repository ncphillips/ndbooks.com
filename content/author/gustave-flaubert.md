Gustave Flaubert (1821–1880) was a French novelist. The son of a surgeon, Flaubert studied law unsuccessfully in Paris and returned home to devote himself to writing. Because of a severe nervous malady he spent most of his life at Croisset, near Rouen, with his mother and niece. In 1856, after five years of work, Flaubert published his masterpiece, _Madame Bovary_, in a Paris journal, followed by _The Sentimental Education_ (1870), _The Temptation of St. Anthony_ (1874), _Three Tales_ (1877). After his death his unfinished satire _Bouvard and Pécuchet_ was published in 1881.
