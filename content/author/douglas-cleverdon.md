Douglas Cleverdon (1903â€“1987) was a British bookseller, broadcaster, publisher, and writer. His career started as the owner of an antiquarian book shop, which later grew into the Douglas Cleverdon publishing house and Clover Press. In 1955, he co-directed stage productions of _Under Milk Wood_ by Dylan Thomas in Edinburgh and London and, two years later, on Broadway. He passed away in 1987.
