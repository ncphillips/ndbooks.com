Leonid Tsypkin (1926–1982) was a pathologist, with a very strong interest in psychiatry, upholding the long tradition of doctors-turned-writers from Chekhov to Aksyonov. He was a devoted admirer of Dostoyevsky’s writings and a collector of Dostoyevsky memorabilia. He started writing prose in the late 1960s, and did not live to see one line of his fiction (unlike his many professional publications) in print. He had been twice denied permission to leave the Soviet Union with his family, and died of a heart attack in Moscow.
