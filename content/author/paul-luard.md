Paul Éluard (1895–1952), born Eugene Émile Paul Grindel, was a French poet instrumental in the Surrealist movement, which he later abandoned for the French Communist Party. The more than seventy books he published included poetry, literary and political works. During his lifetime, he married three times and befriended other surrealists such as Max Ernst and Pablo Picasso. He died in Charenton-le-Pont in 1952.
