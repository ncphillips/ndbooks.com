Martin Grzimek was born in 1950 in Trutzhain, West Germany. His first novel, Berger (1980) was widely praised by German critics, and his work has been placed in a tradition which includes Edgar Allan Poe, Franz Kafka, and Peter Handke. But Grzimekâ€™s voice is distinctly his own; as one critic has remarked, "Prose this subtly nuanced can only be achieved by a writer going his own way."
