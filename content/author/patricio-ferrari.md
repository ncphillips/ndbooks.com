Patricio Ferrari was born in Argentina and has translated Fernando Pessoa, António Osório, and Laynie Browne. A polyglot, his work as a poet, editor, and translator bridges a life between languages. He edited two journals in the U.S. on Pessoa and published eight editions of Pessoa’s works including the first critical edition of his _Poèmes Français_ \[_French Poems_\] (Paris, Editions de la Différence, 2014) and _Teatro Estático_ \[_Static Theater_\] (Tinta da china, 2017). Ferrari resides in New York City and teaches at Rutgers University, while pursuing an on-going collaboration with the Endangered Language Alliance, the only non-profit organization focused on the linguistic diversity of urban areas throughout the world.
