Muriel Spark (1918–2006) began a prolific forty year career as a poet, essayist and novelist some time after marrying and living in Rhodesia, divorcing, moving to London, working for UK intelligence during World War II, and editing _The Poetry Review_. Of Scottish origin, Spark is remembered for the rare artistry of her audacious and often self-reflective fictions (_The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_, _Memento Mori_, _The Comforters_, etc). In 1965, she received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and in 1965 for _The Mendelbaum Gate_. In 1992, she won the US Ingersoll Foundation TS Eliot Award, and in 1997, the David Cohen Prize. Muriel Spark became Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993.
