Hora de Clarice is a worldwide celebration which takes place each year on Clarice Lispector's birthday. Lovers of Lispector come together in Brazil, Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Frankfurt, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and New York to raise a glass to her life and work.  
  
On Sunday, December 10th, 2017, Group .BR, New York's only Brazilian theater company partnered with Salles Institute, Brazil, for an evening of installations and performances from its latest show, _Inside the Wild Heart_, an adaptation of Lispector's first novel. Special guests Katrina Dodson, translator of Complete Stories of Clarice Lispector, and Rebecca Ariel Porte, academic, discussed Lispector's stories "Mineirinho" and "The Egg and the Chicken" with moderator Mila Burns.
