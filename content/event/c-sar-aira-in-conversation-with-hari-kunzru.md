The author of at least eighty novels, most of them no more than 96 pages long, César Aira has been called "the author who can't be stopped" by the _New York Review of Books_. His new book _The Musical Brain & Other Stories_ is the first collection of his stories to appear in English, and comprises twenty tales about oddballs, freaks, and crazies. Aira gives readers imponderables to ponder and bizarre and seemingly out-of-context plot lines to consider, as well as thoughtful and passionate takes on everyday reality. The title story, published in the _New Yorker_, is the centerpiece of this exhilarating collection of characters, places, and ideas—the crème de la crème of Aira's many short stories. Aira talks about his work with acclaimed novelist and journalist [Hari Kunzru](http://www.harikunzru.com/), author most recently of _Gods Without Men_.
