Please join us for a reading and celebration of the latest books by cult writer Fleur Jaeggy. Gini Alhadeff and Minna Zallman Proctor, translators of I AM THE BROTHER OF XX and THESE POSSIBLE LIVES respectively, will discuss the books with writer Claudia Steinberg. Bubbly to follow.

"Her hands, like the claws of a crustacean, clutched a little mound of dust." â€”Fleur Jaeggy, from _I Am the Brother of XX_
