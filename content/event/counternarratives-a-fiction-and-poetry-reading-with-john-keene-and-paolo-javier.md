Counternarratives: A Fiction and Poetry Reading
John Keene and Paolo Javier
With Listening Center

The Brooklyn Rail @ Industry City
In collaboration with Nightboat Books


JOHN KEENE is the author of the novel Annotations (New Directions); the text-art collection Seismosis (1913 Press) with artist Christopher Stackhouse; and the short fiction collection Counternarratives (New Directions). He also translated Brazilian author Hilda Hilstâ€™s novel Letters from a Seducer (Nightboat/A Bolha Editora). He has published his work in a wide array of periodicals and anthologies, and has exhibited his artwork in Brooklyn and Berlin. He teaches in the departments of English and African American and African Studies, which he chairs, and also is a core faculty member in the MFA Program in Creative Writing at Rutgers University-Newark.


PAOLO JAVIER is the former Queens Poet Laureate (2010-14), and author of _Court of the Dragon_, a new book of poetry published by Nightboat Books. His other full length books include T_he Feeling Is Actual_ (Marsh Hawk Press), 60 lv bo(e)mbs (O Books), and the time at the end of this writing (Ahadada), which received a Small Press Traffic Book of the Year Award. He is the recipient of grants from the Queens Council on the Arts and New York State Council on the Arts, and has enjoyed residencies at the Millay Colony of the Arts, The AC Institute, and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's Workspace. Ongoing collaborations include: a synthervention with electronic outfit Listening Center (aka David Mason) of the entire text of Court of the Dragon; and two new comics projects with artist Alex Tarampi.

LISTENING CENTER is the alias of drummer and electronic musician, David Mason. Drawing primarily from influences such as the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, lost film/TV soundtracks, and Kosmische Musik, Listening Center presents a patchwork of imagined pasts/futures, in which the listener can make his or her way through an undergrowth of dream-like melodies and electronic sound palettes which have the effect of being now reassuring, now unsettling.
