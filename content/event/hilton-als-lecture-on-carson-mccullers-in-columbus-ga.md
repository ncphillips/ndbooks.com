Hilton Als will be a keynote speaker in the citywide celebration “Carson at 100: The McCullers Centennial,” marking the 100th anniversary of her birth in Columbus. The events are a joint effort by CVL and the Columbus State University Carson McCullers Center for Writers and Musicians, headquartered in her childhood home, 1519 Stark Ave.

Wunderkind. Respected. Venerated. Scandalous. Misunderstood. With her debut novel, Columbus-born and bred Carson McCullers burst onto the scene at the ripe old age of 23 and helped change the course of Southern (and American) literature forever. Living a life as large and complex as that of her many characters, McCullers helped create the Southern Gothic genre and brought the voice of the “outsider” to the forefront of American letters.

Now, on the occasion of her 100th birthday, the Carson McCullers Center for Writers and Musicians and the Chattahoochee Valley Libraries, in partnership with the cultural organizations of Columbus, GA, join forces to celebrate the artistic legacy of one of its most famous denizens.

“Hilton Als is one of our nation’s preeminent cultural observers and critics,” CVL program coordinator Henry McCoy said in the news release. “His essay on McCullers that appeared in _The New Yorker_ is considered one of finest appreciations of her work in recent memory. Mr. Als has indicated his excitement at being included in the festivities and we’re happy he will be joining us on March 3.”
