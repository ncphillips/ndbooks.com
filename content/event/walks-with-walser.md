_WALKS WITH WALSER_, now finally rendered into English by Anne Posten, is a unique and personal portrait of the beloved, legendary Swiss writer by his dear friend and literary executor Carl Seelig. Come celebrate it's release with us! Posten and Alexandra Kleeman will read selections from the book and discuss Robert Walser and literary friendships.

"To use a word much favoured by Walser himself, it’s delightful."
—Dorian Stuber, _Numero Cinq_
