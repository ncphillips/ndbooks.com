In _The Bughouse: The Poetry, Politics and Madness of Ezra Pound_, Daniel Swift writes an unconventional biography through the stories of Pound’s visitors at St. Elizabeths Hospital, among them T. S. Eliot, Elizabeth Bishop, John Berryman, Robert Lowell, Charles Olson and William Carlos Williams. A captivating look at the most controversial of poets through the eyes of others at a critical moment in Pound’s own life and twentieth-century art and politics.
