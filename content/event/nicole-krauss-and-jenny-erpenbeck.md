Nicole Krauss’s new novel, _Forest Dark_, interweaves the stories of an older lawyer and younger novelist whose transcendental search leads them to the Israeli desert. “A brilliant novel,” wrote Philip Roth. “I am full of admiration.” In _Go, Went, Gone_, Jenny Erpenbeck — “one of the most significant German-language novelists of her generation” (_The Millions_) — explores the European refugee crisis through a retired professor’s encounters with African hunger-strikers.
