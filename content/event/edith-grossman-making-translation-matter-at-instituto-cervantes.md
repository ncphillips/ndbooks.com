The Instituto Cervantes New York and the PEN America Foundation co-present this event honoring Edith Grossman on the occasion of her 80th birthday.

One of the most celebrated literary translators in our times, Grossman has been praised for her translations of work by Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Antonio Muñoz Molina, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and many others. Her acclaimed 2003 translation of Cervantes’ _Don Quixote_ is already considered a classic.

This event will also feature New Directions translators Esther Allen, Susan Bernofsky, Jonathan Cohen, and Michael F. Moore.
