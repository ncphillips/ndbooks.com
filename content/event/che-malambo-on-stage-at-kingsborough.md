“A thrilling display of malambo that doesn’t come around New York too often.” - _The New York Times_

In a thrilling spectacle of percussive dance and music, Che Malambo brings awe-inspiring precision footwork, rhythmic stomping, drumming, singing, and whirling _boleadoras_ (lassos) to our stage. Danced solely by men, the fiery malambo tradition began in the 17th century as competitive duels that would challenge skills of agility, strength, and _zapeteo_, the fast-paced footwork inspired by the rhythm of the galloping horses of their native Argentina.

New Directions will be selling copies of _A Simple Story: The Last Malambo_ by Leila Guerriero at the event.
