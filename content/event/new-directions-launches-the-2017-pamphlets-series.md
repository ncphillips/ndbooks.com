Lesley Harrison and David B. Hobbs will read together at Berl's in DUMBO to celebrate the release of the 2017 New Directions pamphlets series. Harrison is the author of _Blue Pearl_, a collection of poems in which northern landscapes come alive through an intimacy of language that forms a collective sense of place through weather, history, local myths and customs, and childhood fairy tales. David B. Hobbs is the editor of _21 Poems_, the very first collection by George Oppen, recently discovered in Ezra Pound's archive.
