From co-founder Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s first book to the new poetry collection of the 2015-16 U.S. Poet Laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera, City Lights has earned its reputation for publishing cutting-edge fiction, poetry, memoirs, literary translations and books on vital social and political issues. Now sixty years old, City Lights is considered one of America’s major alternative presses. Join in this celebration with City Light’s publisher/executive director Elaine Katzenberger, head bookstore buyer Paul Yamazaki, president of New Directions, Barbara Epler; and moderator, _Los Angeles Times_’ book critic David Ulin.
