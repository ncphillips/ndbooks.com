An evening of reading and discussion with poet **Xi Chuan** and writer **Eliot Weinberger**, introduced by their New Directions editor **Jeffrey Yang**. This event is part of BookExpo America's Global Market Forum Honoring China.

"Xi Chuan's surprising poems reach into tight corners of mind and matter, impersonal but intimate, new to be heard but also oddly familiar. An impressive voice—bold and calm." —Gary Snyder

"Eliot Weinberger's remarkable use of simultaneity and collage is something that didn't quite exist before. His work makes you sit up in your seat." —_Times Literary Supplement_
