Robert Miller Gallery presents _Eighteen Stations_, a special project by Patti Smith.

_Eighteen Stations_ revolves around the world of _M Train_, Smith’s bestselling book released in 2015\. _M Train_ chronicles, as Smith describes, “a roadmap to my life,” as told from the seats of the cafés and dwellings she has worked from globally. Reflecting the themes and sensibility of the book, _Eighteen Stations_ is a meditation on the act of artistic creation. It features the artist’s illustrative photographs that accompany the book’s pages, along with works by Smith that speak to art and literature’s potential to offer hope and consolation. The artist will be reading from _M Train_ at the Gallery throughout the run of the exhibition.
