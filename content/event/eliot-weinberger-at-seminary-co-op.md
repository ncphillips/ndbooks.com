_**The Ghosts of Birds**_ offers thirty-five essays by Eliot Weinberger: the first section of the book continues his linked serial-essay, _An Elemental Thing_, which pulls the reader into “a vortex for the entire universe” (_Boston Review_). Here, Weinberger chronicles a nineteenth-century journey down the Colorado River, records the dreams of people named Chang, and shares other factually verifiable discoveries that seem too fabulous to possibly be true. The second section collects Weinberger’s essays on a wide range of subjects―some of which have been published in _Harper’s_, _New York Review of Books_, and _London Review of Books_―including his notorious review of George W. Bush’s memoir _Decision Points_ and writings about Mongolian art and poetry, different versions of the Buddha, American Indophilia (“There is a line, however jagged, from pseudo-Hinduism to Malcolm X”), Béla Balázs, Herbert Read, and Charles Reznikoff.

_**Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei** _features nineteen different translations of a single poem with comments on each version by Eliot Weinberger and introduction contributed by Octavio Paz.
