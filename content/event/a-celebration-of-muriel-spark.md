A tribute reading to celebrate the centenary of Muriel Spark, “whose wit produced effects and insights only matched in contemporary fiction by the glittering jests of Nabokov,” wrote Shirley Hazzard. The author of _The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_, _The Ballad of Peckham Rye_, _Memento Mori_ and _The Girls of Slender Means_, among many other works of fiction, “Muriel Spark wrote some of the most perfect novels of the last century,” wrote Joseph O’Neill. “A fellow practitioner cannot read her without delight, a technician’s envy and finally a sense of responsibility to not commit the blunder of allowing her name to fall into minorness.”
