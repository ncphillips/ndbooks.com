Born in the Bukovina province of Romania, **Norman Manea**’s life and work were marked by his early years in a concentration camp, his afterlife under communist dictatorship and exile. Manea’s books were translated in more than 20 languages and his articles, essays and short prose appeared in many more countries. His most important work is _The Hooligan’s Return: A Memoir._
