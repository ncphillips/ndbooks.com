New Directions and McNally Jackson Bookstore invite you to the New York City launch of TEETH OF THE COMB by Osama Alomar. Please join us for a reading with Alomar followed by a conversation with WNYC producer Mythili Rao.

OSAMA ALOMAR was born in Damascus, Syria, in 1968, and lives in Pittsburgh. He is the author of four acclaimed collections in Arabic and performs as a musician.

MYTHILI RAO is a producer at The New Yorker Radio Hour. Her book reviews and reporting have appeared in The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Daily Beast, and other publications.

Praise for TEETH OF THE COMB translated by C. J. Collins:

"Elegant masterpieces of compression, fables worthy of Kafka: swamps and streams, lightning and dogs all play a part in these beguiling, suggestive fables. The stories are of perfect length, but one wishes the book went on for much longer."—Kirkus (starred review)

"There are no wasted words in Alomar’s beautiful collection: philosophical and subversive, these tiny parables deliver the kind of stunning maxims that convey a plea for progress and improvement. Alomar's writing brims with hope, and this slim volume is full of compassion and depth."—_Publisher's Weekly_
