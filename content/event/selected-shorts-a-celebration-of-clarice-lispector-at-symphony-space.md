Host **Denis O'Hare** (_American Horror Story_), **Lynn Cohen** (_Sex and the City_), **Carolina Ravassa** (_The Affair_), and more perform stories by one of Brazil's greatest modern writers. With commentary by novelist and translator Idra Novey (_Ways to Disappear_).

A cultural icon in Brazil, her work has only recently come to light in the States thanks to an award-winning translation published by New Directions. Arresting, magnetic and remarkable, her stories blend the mundane and the mystical, leaving readers unsettled somewhere in between.

"[Her characters] ask small questions but there is always the sense that the answers might turn out to be much larger, or more disquieting, than [they] have bargained for."

--Colm Toibin

“And when I think a word is strange that’s where it achieves the meaning. And when I think life is strange that’s where life begins.”
--Clarice Lispector

**Selected Shorts** is produced by Symphony Space and broadcast on more than 150 stations around the country. The Selected Shorts podcast consistently ranks as one of the most popular podcasts on iTunes. The series began in 1985 and enjoys sold-out performances to this day. Selected Shorts was conceived with a simple premise: take great stories by well-known and emerging writers and have them performed by terrific actors of stage and screen. Featuring stories around a lively theme, the favorite works of a guest author, or a special collaboration, each Selected Shorts event is a unique night of literature in performance.

Premium tickets are available and include a $50 tax-deductible donation to Symphony Space.

Actors subject to change.
