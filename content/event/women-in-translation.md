**Susan Bernofsky** directs the translation program at Columbia University’s School of the Arts. Her translations include works by Robert Walser, Yoko Tawada, Jenny Erpenbeck, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse. The recipient of numerous awards (most recently the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize and the Schlegel-Tieck Prize), she blogs about translation at [www.translationista.com](http://www.translationista.net/) and is currently writing a biography of Robert Walser.

**John Keene’s** most recent books include the short fiction collection [_Counternarratives_](http://www.bookculture.com/book/9780811225526) (New Directions, 2015), which received a 2016 American Book Award, a 2016 Lannan Literary Award for Fiction, and in March 2017 the UK's inaugural Republic of Consciousness Prize; the art book _GRIND_ (ITI Press, 2016), an art-text collaboration with photographer Nicholas Muellner; and the poetry chapbook _Playland_ (Seven Kitchens Press, 2016). He is also the translator of Brazilian author Hilda Hilst’s novel _[Letters from a Seducer](http://www.bookculture.com/book/9781937658151)_ (Nightboat Books / A Bolha Editora, 2014), and other works of fiction and poetry. He chairs the department of African American and African Studies, and also teaches English and creative writing at Rutgers University-Newark.

**Nathan Xavier Osorio** is a poet, translator, and community organizer. He has taught classes on the intersections of creative writing, translation, and activism at Barnard College, the New School, and Columbia University, where he received his MFA in poetry. His writing can be found at Mexico City Lit, the Offing, and Boston Review's Poems for Political Disaster.

The night will begin with a reception, followed by a reading and discussion with Susan, Nathan, and John.
