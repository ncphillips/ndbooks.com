New Directions is thrilled to announce the publication of two major discoveries of works by Junichiro Tanizaki: _**The Maids**,_ Tanizaki'sastonishing final novel, and **_Devils in Daylight_**, a suspenseful early novellaâ€”now in English for the first time.

To celebrate, New Directions and The Metrograph invite you to a rare screening of Kon Ichikawa's acclaimed film adaption of _The Makioka Sisters._ The event will be introduced by critic and historian, Ian Buruma.
