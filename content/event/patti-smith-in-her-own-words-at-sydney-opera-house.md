In a rare solo appearance **Patti Smith** will take to the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre as part of the **Sydney Opera House Talks & Ideas** program – to talk, read and sing from her acclaimed body of work.

Smith will discuss the many and varied dimensions of a career that spans thirteen studio albums, visual arts, poetry, a memoir and fiction.

In 2005, Patti Smith received the Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the highest honour awarded by the French Republic to eminent artists and writers. In 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a year later, the Foundation Cartier pour l’Art Contemporain held a major retrospective of her artwork.

Her Sydney Opera House visit will be her only solo event on her sold out Australian tour.
