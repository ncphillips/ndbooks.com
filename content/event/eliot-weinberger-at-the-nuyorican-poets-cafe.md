**Eliot Weinberger** will be joined by acclaimed European and American poets in this Evening of Poetry and Prose at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.

Tickets are $8 - $12.

**Eliot Weinberger** is an essayist, political commentator, translator, and editor. His books of avant-gardist literary essays include _Karmic Traces_, _An Elemental Thing_ (named by the _Village Voice_ as one of the "20 Best Books of the Year") and, most recently, _Oranges & Peanuts for Sale_. His political articles are collected in _What I Heard About Iraq—_called by the _Guardian_ the one antiwar "classic" of the Iraq war—and _What Happened Here: Bush Chronicles_. The author of a study of Chinese poetry translation, _19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei_, he is the translator of the poetry of Bei Dao, and the editor of _The New Directions Anthology of Classical Chinese Poetry_ and the _Calligrams_ series published by NYRB Classics. His other anthologies include _World Beat: International Poetry Now from New Directions_ and _American Poetry Since 1950: Innovators & Outsiders_. Among his translations of Latin American poetry and prose are the _Collected Poems 1957–1987 of Octavio Paz_, Vicente Huidbro's _Altazor_, and Jorge Luis Borges’ _Selected Non-Fictions_, which received the National Book Critics Circle award for criticism. He was born in New York City, where he still lives. Often presented as a "post-national" writer, his work has been translated into thirty languages, and appears frequently in the _New York Review of Books_, the _London Review of Books_, and periodicals and newspapers abroad.
