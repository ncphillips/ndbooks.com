Poet **Pattie McCarthy**, known for re-visioning historical texts, joins living legend and 2017 Robert Frost Medal recipient **Susan Howe** on the occasion of her 80th birthday for an evening of readings and conversation. Howe is the author of multiple poetry collections, including _That This, The Midnight, Kidnapped, The Europe of Trusts_, and, most recently, _Debths_. Celebrated for her historical eye and innovative verse, Howe remains one of the preeminent voices of her generation.
