_Slight Exaggeration_ is the new collection of criticism, personal reflection, European history and aphoristic musings by Adam Zagajewski — “the most pertinent, impressive and meaningful poet of our time,” wrote Mary Oliver. “He speaks passionately from both the historical and the personal perspective in poems reduced to a clean, lyrical clarity.” In her new work of nonfiction, _The Beekeeper: Rescuing the Stolen Women of Iraq_, poet and journalist Dunya Mikhail tells the harrowing but hopeful stories of Yazidi women who escaped the genocidal extremism of ISIS. Her writing is “remarkable, winding work that ascends into dream visions and crawls through gory particulars of war,” wrote _The Washington Post_. “A child’s perspective mingles freely with the poet’s mature voice, both baffled by the paradoxes of so much beauty and so much destruction.
