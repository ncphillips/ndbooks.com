**This event has been cancelled.**

Nathaniel Tarn will read at Open Books and Lindsay Hill in celebration of Tarn's recently published poetry collection, _Gondwana._

Gondwana: an ancient supercontinent long dispersed into fragments. Contemplating the ethereal blue is of Antarctica, once part of it, Nathaniel Tarn writes in the opening section of his magnificent collection: "They said back then/ there was a frozen continent/ in those high latitudes encircling globe:/ are you moving toward it?"From there, the rising and falling stairs at Fez in Morocco meld into a cantata on marriage, empire, and the meditational nature of climbing. In a series of beautiful, short poems "Il Piccolo Paradiso," Tarn creates a haven of home, bird flight, and innvervating flight. In another section, the heroic WWII fighter Pilot Lydia Litvyak is personified as Eurydice speaking to her lover captain, Orpheus. The book concludes with the powerful poems of "Exitus Generis Humani," its polyphonic lines slowly pouring over the reader in a mournful, yet often humorous, reverie that reveals allegiance to Earth as the essential divinity, while calling for radical change if we want to prevent a definitive ending.

Lindsay Hill was born in San Francisco and graduated from Bard College. Since 1974, he has published six books of poetry, including _Contango_ and _The Empty Quarter_ (both from Singing Horse Press), and his work has appeared in a wide variety of literary journals. Sea of Hooks, his first novel, was published by McPherson &amp; Company in 2013\. Sea of Hooks won the 2014 PEN Center USA Fiction Award, the 2015 IPPY Gold Medal for Literary Fiction, and the 2016 Dactyl Foundation Literary Fiction Award. Lindsay works in the nonprofit sector and lives in Spokane with his wife, the painter Nita Hill.
