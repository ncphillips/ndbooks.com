Join poet and essayist **Susan Howe** and **Marta Werner**, professor of English at D’Youville College, for an evening of lecture and discussion centered on Emily Dickinson’s unique manuscript practice. Howe and Werner will chart the visual and sonic topographies of Dickinson’s poetry and letters, while also raising questions about writing, the limits of privacy, and the indecipherable nature of final intentions. Audience members are encouraged to be active participants in the conversation.

The exhibition _I’m Nobody! Who are you? The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson_ will open at 5:30 pm for program attendees.

Friday, February 10, 6:30 pm

Tickets: $15; free for members and students with valid ID. Tickets include free museum admission for the day of program.
