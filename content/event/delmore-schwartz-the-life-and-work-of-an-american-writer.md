This AWP Conference panel celebrates the publication of a new selection of Schwartz’s writings (_Once and For All_, New Directions 2016) and features talks and readings from Schwartz’s body of work from poetry and fiction writers who owe him a debt.

Delmore Schwartz was an early darling of the generation of American writers that emerged in the 1940s, a pioneer of confessional poetry and Jewish American fiction. His own long descent into mental illness and substance abuse, as well as changing tastes, left his legacy in disarray.

The panel will feature Craig Morgan Teicher, Stephen (sometimes Stephanie) Burt, Kevin Prufer, and Caroline Casey.
