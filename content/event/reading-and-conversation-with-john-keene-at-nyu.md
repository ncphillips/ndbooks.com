Join us for a reading and discussion of John Keene's acclaimed novel, _Counternarratives_. The book is a collection of novellas and stories that offers new perspectives on familiar characters and histories — ranging from Huckleberry Finn and Langston Hughes to the American Revolution and early colonial South America — as inspired by real events and records. Panelists discuss the book's unique format and its political and historical commentary.

Panelists include:

*   **John Keene**, Associate Professor, Departments of English and African American Studies, Rutgers-Newark
*   **Phillip Brian Harper**, Erich Maria Remarque Professor of Literature and Professor of Social & Cultural Analysis, New York University
*   **Sonya Posmentier**, Assistant Professor of English, New York University
