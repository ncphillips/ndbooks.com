Ignoring verisimilitude is one of the ways to tear down the division between fiction and reality. CÃ©sar Aira tells stories, sometimes with many realist overtones, but he always upsets the plausible and avoids incidental elements to set his story. The Argentine author will discuss his most recent English publication, The Musical Brain and Other Stories, with Sergio Chejfec, inviting us to that peculiar universe which proves that in life there are events that cannot be explained by Western Rationalism. In Spanish with simultaneous translation.
