Words of War, Words of Loss.

Poetry has always been central to Arabic cultural expression. Today, it encompasses the whirlwind of events sweeping across the Middle East, serving to mourn tragedy and articulate political fantasies. **Robyn Creswell**, co-author of _The New Yorker_ article “Why Jihadists Write Poetry,” and Iraqi poet **Dunya Mikhail**, who fled her country after being put on Sadaam Hussein’s enemies list, discuss poetry as a way to understand contemporary Arab society. A book signing will follow the program.

This program is co-sponsored by Poets House and City Lore.

_The Heart of the Matter is a series of live talks with guest experts exploring current events in the Middle East and post-9/11 security issues._
