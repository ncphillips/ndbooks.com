Cynthia Nixon delivers a triumphant performance as Emily Dickinson as she personifies the wit, intellectual independence and pathos of the poet whose genius only came to be recognized after her death. Acclaimed British director Terence Davies (THE DEEP BLUE SEA, HOUSE OF MIRTH, THE LONG DAY CLOSES) exquisitely evokes Dickinson’s deep attachment to her close knit family along with the manners, mores and spiritual convictions of her time that she struggled with and transcended in her poetry. _The New Yorker’s_ Richard Brody calls it “an absolute drop-dead masterwork”. The cast also includes Jennifer Ehle and Keith Carradine. Join director Terence Davies for a post-screening discussion. A Music Box Films release (in theaters April 14, 2017)

(2016, 125 minutes)

The exhibition [_I’m Nobody! Who are you? The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson_](http://www.themorgan.org/exhibitions/emily-dickinson) will be open at 6 pm for program attendees.
