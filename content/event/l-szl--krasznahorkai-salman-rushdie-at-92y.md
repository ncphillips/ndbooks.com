A rare US appearance by László Krasznahorkai—the “contemporary Hungarian master of apocalypse,” wrote Susan Sontag. Winner of this year’s Man Booker International Prize, Krasznahorkai is author of _The Melancholy of Resistance_, _Satantango_ and _Seiobo There Below_. His new collection of nonfiction is _Destruction and Sorrow Beneath the Heavens: Reportage_.

He is joined by one of his biggest local admirers, Salman Rushdie, whose new novel, _Two Years, Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights_, is set in a New York of the near future made strange after a massive storm. “He is rare and magical writer,” wrote Michael Chabon.
