Playhouse Creatures Theatre Company is excited to announce its upcoming production of Tennessee Williams’ “The Two-Character Play” with Irene Glezos and Joseph W. Rodriguez.

Director Austin Pendleton says of the play: "I don't think I have ever worked on a play as unstintingly personal...It's like a goofy Greek tragedy, in which two outrageous people are made (by themselves) to face the darkest truths about themselves."
