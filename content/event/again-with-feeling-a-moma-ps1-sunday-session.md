The artist-to-artist exchanges in BOMB go beyond simple dialogue to the ideas at the heart of artistic practice. In a Sunday Session celebrating the magazine's 35th anniversary, ten pairs of artists will revisit their original conversations, ranging from: The emotional nitroglycerine Nicole Eisenman finds in David Humphrey's paintings, the aesthetic high Richard Foreman gets from cutting his plays mid-rehearsal, Tom Burr's queering of institutional critique, and Ralph Lemon's spin on racial profiling in the art world.

Participants will go off script and digress, expand, retract, negate, disavow, and redact themselves at will.
