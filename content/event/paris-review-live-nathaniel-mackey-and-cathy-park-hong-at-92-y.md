Over the years, the Poetry Center has teamed with _The Paris Review_ to present numerous onstage conversations that have often led to Writers-at-Work interviews appearing in the magazine. In this latest installment, poet Nathaniel Mackey—winner of this year's Bollingen Prize—will read from his work and sit for a conversation with Cathy Park Hong.
