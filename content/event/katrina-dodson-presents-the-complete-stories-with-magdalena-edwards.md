She received a PhD in Comparative Literature from UCLA with a dissertation titled "The Translator's Colors: Elizabeth Bishop in Brazil & Elsewhere." Her work has appeared in the _Boston Review, The Paris Review Daily, the Los Angeles Review of Books, Rattle, The Critical Flame, Rewire Me_, and _The Millions_.
