_Al Que Quiere!_ is William Carlos Williams's third collection  of poems, and demonstrates his mature poetic voice. Williams, a great  American poet of the 20th century, had close ties to the Spanish  language through his Puerto Rican mother as well as his Spanish-speaking  father, and he had a deep appreciation for Spanish literature. In  collaboration with New Directions on issue of the "Centennial Edition"  of Williams's poetry book, editor **Jonathan Cohen** together with poet-critics **Julio Marzán** and **Mónica de la Torre** will guide us through the work and highlight its essential Spanish elements.
