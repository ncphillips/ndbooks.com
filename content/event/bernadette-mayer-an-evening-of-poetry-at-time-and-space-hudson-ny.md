Bernadette Mayer is an avant-garde writer associated with the New York School of poets. Her newest collection, Works and Days (2016), is a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award. Bernadette’s poetry often challenges poetic conventions by experimenting with form and stream-of-consciousness. Readers have compared her to Gertrude Stein, Dadaist writers, and James Joyce. She has taught at the New School for Social Research and The Poetry Project at St. Mark’s Church in New York City. In 2015 Bernadette was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship.
