With Anna Della Subin, Gini Alhadeff, Omar Berrada, Robyn Creswell, Sukhdev Sandhu, Emily Stokes & Eliot Weinberger.

Writer and editor Anna Della Subin presents a reading of Tawfiq al-Hakim’s 1933 play _The People of the Cave_ as part of Triple Canopy’s [The Long Tomorrow](http://canopycanopycanopy.com/issues/21) issue. The play, based on the legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, which also appears in the Qur’an, tells the story of three Christian men and a dog who awaken in a cave after fleeing from persecution by their pagan king. Upon venturing out, the men discover that three hundred years have passed, and must come to terms with a transformed world. Though hailed in literary circles as a landmark in Egyptian drama, the play flopped with audiences, some of whom fell asleep.

_The People of the Cave_, and the myth that inspired it, are the subject of Subin’s forthcoming ebook from Triple Canopy, _Not Dead But Sleeping_. The long essay, prompted by the 2011 Egyptian uprisings, traces the origins and incarnations of the sleepers, a story told and retold at moments of political awakening. It considers the myth’s speculative uses and revolutionary potential, poetically pushing back against Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous dictum that “There is nothing more tragic than to sleep through a revolution.”

Subin will introduce the play, starring Gini Alhadeff as the Princess Priska, Omar Berrada as Marnush, Robyn Creswell as the King, Sukhdev Sandhu as Mishlinya, Emily Stokes as the tutor Gallias, and Eliot Weinberger as the shepherd Yamlikha.
