This event has been cancelled.

Nathaniel Tarn, author of the recently published _Gondwana_, and Steve Dickison will read at Moe's Books in Berkeley, California.

Nathaniel Tarn is an American poet, essayist, anthropologist, and translator with some thirty books and booklets published in his various disciplines. Born in Paris, Tarn graduated in history and English as a Scholar of King’s College, Cambridge. He returned to Paris and, after some journalism and radio work, discovered anthropology at the Musée de l’Homme, the Ecole des Hautes Etudes, and the Collège de France. A Fulbright grant took him to Yale and the University of Chicago where Robert Redfield sent him to Guatemala for his doctoral fieldwork. He completed this work as a graduate student at the London School of Economics. In 1958, a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation sent him to Burma for 18 months after which he became Lecturer in South East Asian Anthropology at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London. In 1970, he immigrated to the US as Visiting Professor of Romance Languages, Princeton University, and became a citizen. Since then he has taught English and American Literature, Epic Poetry, Folklore, inter alia at the Universities of SUNY Buffalo, Pennsylvania, Colorado, New Mexico, and Manchuria. He now resides in New Mexico.


Steve Dickison is author of Disposed (Post-Apollo, 2007) and, forthcoming in 2018, Zora Neale Hurston's Liberation Music Orchestra; guest-editor, with David Meltzer, for the "Shuffle Boil" special issue of Amerarcana; and director of The Poetry Center at San Francisco State University, teaching there and at California College of the Arts. He lives in San Francisco.
