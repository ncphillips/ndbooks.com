The Brooklyn Book Festival and _Harper's_ Magazine present "Writing and Motherhood/Writing on Motherhood" at Book Culture on Columbus.

Authors Rivka Galchen (_Little Labors_) and Heidi Julavits (_The Folded Clock_) will discuss writing about motherhood and writing while mothering. There's an art to both, and a process, in addition to a lot of hard work and love. Moderated by Giulia Melucci (_Harper's Magazine/I Loved, I Lost, I Made Spaghetti_)
