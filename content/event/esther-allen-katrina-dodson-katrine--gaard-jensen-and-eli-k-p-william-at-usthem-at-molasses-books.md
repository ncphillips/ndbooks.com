Us&Them gives literary translators with parallel careers as writers a place to showcase both sides of their work. Readings are hosted four times a year at Molasses Books in Bushwick.

Esther Allen and Katrina Dodson will be sharing the Us&Them spotlight on Friday 4/28 at Molasses Books with Danish translator Katrine Jensen and Japanese sci-fi translator Eli K.P. William.
