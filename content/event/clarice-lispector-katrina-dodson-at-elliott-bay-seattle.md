Join Elliott Bay Book Company for an evening of reading and discussion of Clarice Lispector with Katrina Dodson (translator of Lispector's _The Complete Stories_). "Clarice Lispector has a diamond-hard intelligence, a visionary instinct, and a sense of humor that veered from naíf wonder to wicked comedy…she attempts to capture what it is to think our existence as we are in it - in the ‘marvelous scandal,’ as Lispector puts it, of life.” - Rachel Kushner, Bookforum.
