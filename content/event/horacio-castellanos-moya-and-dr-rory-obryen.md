[](http://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/profiles/horacio-castellanos-moya)Horacio Castellanos Moya will be in conversation at the Bookshop with Dr. Rory O'Bryen[](http://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/profiles/dr-rory-obryen). Best known in the UK for novels such as [_Revulsion: Thomas Bernhard in San Salvador_](http://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/on-our-shelves/book/9780811225397/revulsion-thomas-bernhard-in-san-salvador) and [_The Dream of My Return_](http://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/on-our-shelves/book/9780811223430/dream-of-my-return), Castellanos Moya is a writer who, in the words of Natasha Wimmer, 'has turned anxiety into an art-form and an act of rebellion, and redeemed paranoia as a positive indicator of rot'.

This event takes place in association with [Cervantes Institute London](http://londres.cervantes.es/en/default.shtm) and the Embassy of El Salvador.
