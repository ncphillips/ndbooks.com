In the quiet suburbs, while Dorothy is doing chores and waiting for her husband to come home from work, not in the least anticipating romance, she hears a strange radio announcement about a monster who has just escaped from the Institute for Oceanographic Research...

_Mrs. Caliban_ by Rachel Ingalls is a quiet, bizarre masterpiece, like a Richard Yates novel adapted into a B-movie. Heralded by Ursula K. Le Guin, John Updike, and Joyce Carol Oates, the novel has been passed around writers' hands since its original publication in 1982\. Now finally back in print, Ingalls's “totally unforgettable” ( _New York Times_) and “something of a miracle” (_New Yorker_) novel is poised to be cherished by another generation of readers.

Rivka Galchen (_Little Labors_) and Christine Smallwood will discuss the novel, followed by Galchen and Hampton Fancher (_Blade Runner_, _Blade Runner 2049_) reading an excerpt of Fancher's screenplay adaptation of _Mrs. Caliban_.

**Rivka Galchen**'s 2008 first novel _Atmospheric Disturbances_ and her 2014 story collection _American Innovations_ were both _New York Times_ Best Books of the Year. Her latest book is _Little Labors_, out with New Directions. She has received many awards as well as an MD from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Galchen lives in New York City.

**Hampton Fancher** is an actor, dancer, writer, and director known for _Blade Runner, The Minus Man,_and most recently _Blade Runner 2049_. His short story collection, _The Shape of the Final Dog_, was published in 2012\. Fancher is the subject of the documentary _Escapes_, directed by Michael Almereyda and produced by Wes Anderson.

**Christine Smallwood** writes the "New Books" column for Harper's Magazine. Her fiction has been published in _The Paris Review, n+1_, and _Vice_.
