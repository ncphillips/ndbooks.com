<u>**Praise for Eliot Weinberger:**</u>

"One remains in silent amazement: How does he find these stories? How does he know everything?" —_Die Zeit_

"His essays are dense collages of magical facts that make me ecstatic every time I read them." —Sam Anderson, _The New York Times_

"As is often the case with brilliant writers, an Eliot Weinberger sentence cannot be mistaken for that of anyone else." —Will Heyward, _Australian Book Review_

"The brilliant net of details that Weinberger casts and recasts in his various inventive approaches to form is precisely what constitutes a superlative poetic imagination. And it’s what holds the essays—and us—trembling and raging and hallucinating together." —Forrest Gander

"Our personal favorite for the Nobel Prize." —_Rolling Stone_ (Germany)
