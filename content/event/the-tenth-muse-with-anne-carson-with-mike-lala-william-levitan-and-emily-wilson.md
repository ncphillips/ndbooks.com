Renowned as a poet and classical translator, Anne Carson continues a long-standing Poetry Center tradition by introducing readings by three of her favorite translators: Mike Lala (Catullus), William Levitan (Seneca, the letters of Abelard and Heloise) and Emily Wilson (Euripides, Homer). “You’re down in the roots of where words work,” wrote Carson of translating Greek and Latin. “In English we’re at the top of the tree, in the branches, bouncing around. It was stunning to me, a revelation. And it continues to be stunning. It’s a home, a home in my mind.”
