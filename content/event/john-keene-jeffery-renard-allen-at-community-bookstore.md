John Keene discusses his new book, _Counternarratives_, with author [Jeffery Renard Allen](http://www.jefferyrenardallen.com/).

"Only a few, John Keene among them, in our age, authentically test the physics of fiction as both provocation and mastery. Continuing what reads like the story collection as freedom project, in _Counternarratives_, Keene opens swaths of history for readers to more than imagine but to manifest and live in the passionate language of conjure and ritual." â€”Major Jackson
