**This event has been cancelled.**

Nathaniel Tarn will read from his recently published collection of poems, _Gondwana,_ at Seminary Co-op in Chicago. He will be joined in conversation by Peter O'Leary.

_Gondwana_: an ancient supercontinent long dispersed into fragments. Contemplating the ethereal blue is of Antartica, once part of it, Nathaniel Tarn writes in the opening section of his magnificent collection: "They said back then / there was a frozen continent / in those high latitudes encircling globe: / are you moving toward it?" From there, the rising and falling stairs at Fez in Morocco meld into a cantata on marriage, empire, and the meditational nature of climbing. In a series of beautiful, short poems "Il Piccolo Paradiso," Tarn creates a haven of home, bird flight, and innvervating flight. In another section, the heroic WWII fighter Pilot Lydia Litvyak is personified as Eurydice speaking to her lover captain, Orpheus. The book concludes with the powerful poems of "Exitus Generis Humani," its polyphonic lines slowly pouring over the reader in a mournful, yet often humorous, reverie that reveals allegiance to Earth as the essential divinity, while calling for radical change if we want to prevent a definitive ending.


Peter Oâ€™Leary is the author of several books of poetry, most recently _The Sampo_ (Cultural Society), a book-length fantasy poem set in the far north, featuring a wizard, a sorceress, a sword, and a mysterious magical object of absorbing perfection. A new book of criticism, _Thick and Dazzling Darkness: Religious Poetry in a Secular Age_, is forthcoming from Columbia University Press. He lives in Oak Park and teaches at both the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the University of Chicago.
