This gathering celebrates the extraordinary importance of Raymond Roussel’s literature and its influence on the arts of the 20th century. His impact on avant-garde artists can be felt in the works of artists such as Duchamp, Dalí, Max Ernst, Picabia, Matta, Man Ray, Ree Morton, Joseph Cornell, Richard Hamilton, Julio Cortázar, Michel Leiris, René Daniëls, OuLiPo, Jean Rouch, Cristina Iglesias and Francisco Tropa, among many others.

On this occasion we will also pay tribute to John Ashbery, co-founder ofthe Raymond Roussel Society. Ashbery is one of the eminent figures in the current New York poetry scene. He has been awarded all the major prizes, such as the Pulitzer in 1976, and is the best-selling poet in the United States.

This event is free and in English.
