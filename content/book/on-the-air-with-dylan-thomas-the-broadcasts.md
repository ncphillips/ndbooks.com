A book full of surprises and delights, _On the Air with Dylan Thomas_ presents all of Thomas’s BBC radio work (with the exception of "Under Milk Wood", which is available separately). Thomas served his broadcasting apprenticeship as a teenager with his friend Daniel Jones. They set up a "station" between the second and first floors of the Jones’ home "Warmley," dubbing it the Warmley Broadcasting Company. Then, starting in 1943 and continuing to his death, Thomas often sat behind a BBC microphone, variously giving radio talks, introducing poetry selections, participating in round-table discussions, reading dramas, essays, and poems. His was a glorious voice and he had a special case and inventiveness on the air.
