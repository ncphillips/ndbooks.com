The art of the informal essay finds elegant voice in Oscar Mandel’s _The Book of Elaborations_. Like Montaigne before him, Mandel examines the antic mind of his fellow men, vain, various, and ever-changing, and its peculiar manifestations in an age that embraces ugliness and irrationality. The sixteen pieces in the collection are, literally, "elaborations"––discursive, associative, meditative––of the author’s earlier lyric poems and epigrams, arranged by him to move in an easy way from the autobiographical to matters more general and abstract.
