Champion of the International Poetry Slam, winner of the Before Columbus American Book Award, the International Hispanic Heritage Award, the Pushcart Prize, and the prestigious International Award, Jimmy Santiago Baca has been writing as a mestizo (part Native American, part Mexican) and an outsider ever since he learned to read and write — in English — during a six-year Federal prison sentence when he was in his twenties. Drawing on his rich ethnic heritage and his life growing up in poverty in the Southwestern United States, Baca has a created a body of work which speaks to the disenfranchised by drawing on his experiences as a prisoner, a father, a poet, and by reflecting on the lush, and sometimes stark, landscape of the Rio Grande valley. In response to increased demand for Latino poetry in Spanish, and to thousands of Baca fans who are bilingual, this unique collection contains Spanish translations of Baca’s poetry selected from the volumes _Martín and Mediations on the South Valley_ (1987), _Black Mesa Poems_ (1989), _Immigrants in Our Own Land_ (1990), _Healing Earthquakes_ (2001), _C-Train and Thirteen Mexicans_ (2002), _Winter Poems Along the Rio Grande_ (2004), and _Spring Poems Along the Rio Grande_ (2007).
