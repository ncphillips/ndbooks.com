In _Frame Structures_, Susan Howe brings together those of her earliest poems she wishes to remain in print, and in the forms in which she cares to have them last. Gathered here are versions of _Hinge Picture_ (1974), _Chanting at the Crystal Sea_ (1975), _Cabbage Gardens_ (1979), and _Secret History of the Dividing Line_ (1978) that differ in some respects from their original small-press editions. In a long preface, "Frame Structures," written especially for this volume, Howe suggests the autobiographical, familial, literary, and historical motifs that suffuse these early works. Taken together, the preface and poems reflect her rediscovered sense of her own beginnings as a poet, her movement from the visual arts into the iconography of the written word.

Susan Howe is a professor of English at the State University of New Yorkâ€”Buffalo. Most of her later poetry has been collected in _The Nonconformist's Memorial_ (New Directions, 1993), _The Europe of Trusts: Selected Poems_ (Sun & Moon Press, 1990), and _Singularities_ (Wesleyan University Press, 1990). She is also the author of two landmark books of postmodernist criticism, _The Birth-mark: unsettling the wilderness in American literary history_ (Wesleyan University Press, 1993) and _My Emily Dickinson_ (North Atlantic Books, 1985).
