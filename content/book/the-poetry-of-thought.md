With his hallmark forceful discernment, George Steiner offers _The Poetry of Thought_ as his magnum opus: an examination of more than two millennia of Western culture that argues on behalf of the essential oneness of great thought and great style. Sweeping yet precise, moving from essential detail to bracing illustration, Steiner spans the entire history of philosophy in the West as it entwines with literature, finding that, as Sartre stated, in all philosophy there is “a hidden literary prose.”

"The poetic genius of abstract thought,” Steiner believes, “is lit, is made audible. Argument, even analytic, has its drumbeat. It is made ode. What voices the closing movements of Hegel’s _Phenomenology_ better than Edith Piaf’s _non de non_, a twofold negation which Hegel would have prized? This essay is an attempt to listen more closely.”
