Larger than life―a fable, a Greek tragedy, a comedy, a melodrama―the Tony Award-winning _The Rose Tattoo_ is a valentine from Tennessee Williams to anyone who has ever been in love. In the midst of her anger and grief over the news that her late husband had been unfaithful, Serafina delle Rosa is courted by a Sicilian truck driver who has the virile body of her husband and the face of a clown—his name, Mangiacavallo, means “eat a horse” in Italian. Teary-eyed, he declares, "I am a human being that drives a truck of bananas." His clumsy flirting unlocks Serafina's fiery passion, wit, and eventually, her capacious love.
