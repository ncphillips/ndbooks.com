Now available as a paperback, _The Promises of Glass_ is Michael Palmerâ€™s first new collection of poems since _At Passages_ (New Directions, 1995). _The Promises of Glass_ contains seven sections: "The White Notebook," "The Promises of Glass," "Q," "Four Kitaj Studies,"" Five Easy Poems," "In an X," and "Tower." _The Boston Book Review_ remarked that _The Promises of Glass_ "seems to shimmer with an immaculate glow"; _Publishers Weekly_ called it "superbly strange, sharply provocative, full of slippery acoustic pleasures." Reviewing this collection, _The Village Voice Literary Supplement_ acclaimed Palmer "the most influential avant-gardist working, and perhaps the greatest poet of his generation."
