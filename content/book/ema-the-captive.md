In nineteenth-century Argentina, Ema, a delicate woman of indeterminate origins, is captured by soldiers and taken, along with her newborn babe, to live as a concubine in a crude fort on the very edges of civilization. The trip is appalling (deprivations and rapes prevail along the way), yet the real story commences once Ema arrives at the fort. There she takes on a succession of lovers among the soldiers and Indians, before launching a grand and brave business<span class="st">—</span> an enterprise never before conceived<span class="st">—</span>there in the wilds. As is usual with Aira’s work, the wonder if _Ema, The Captive_ emanates from the wonderful details of customs, beauty, and language, and the curious, perplexing reality of human nature.
