_Lands of Memory_ presents a half-dozen wonderful works by Felisberto Hernandez: "A writer like no other," Italo Calvino declared, "like no European or Latin American. He is an ’irregular,’ who eludes all classification and labels - yet he is unmistakable on any page to which one might randomly open one of his books." Named a Guardian Best Book of the Year by Alfred Brendel and A TLS Best Book of the Year by Michael Hofmann (who calls Felisberto "a loopier, vegetarian Kafka, inhabiting his mazy personal baroque"), _Lands of Memory_ collects four astonishing stories and the two dreamlike novellas, "Around the Time of Clemente Colling" and "Lands of Memory."
