First published in 1934, _Goodbye to Berlin_ has been popularized on stage and screen by Julie Harris in _I Am a Camera_ and Liza Minelli in _Cabaret_. Isherwood magnificently captures 1931 Berlin: charming with its avenues and cafés; marvelously grotesque with its nightlife and dreamers; dangerous with its vice and intrigue; powerful and seedy with its mobs and millionaires. The shadow of Hitler looms menacingly, towering higher and higher. _Goodbye to Berlin_ is inhabited by a wealth of characters: the unforgettable and "divinely decadent" Sally Bowles; plump Fraülein Schroeder, who considers reducing her _Büste_ to relieve heart palpitations; Peter and Otto, a gay couple struggling with their relationship; and the distinguished and doomed Jewish family the Landauers.
