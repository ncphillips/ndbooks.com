_By the Waters of Manhattan_ was published by New Directions in 1962. In the introduction C.P Snow writes, "[Reznikoff] is a deep, sarcastic, lonely writer. So far as I know, he is a writer quite on his own. His poems have moved me deeply and have engrossed me. They stand on their own.... I am anxious that people should read them."
