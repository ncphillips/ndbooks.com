From as early as the seventh century up to the present day, no other country has had so many important women poets as Japan. In this collection (originally published by The Seabury Press in 1977 as _The Burning Heart_), Kenneth Rexroth and Ikuko Atsumi have assembled representative works of seventy-seven poets. Starting with the Classic period (645-1603 A.D.), characterized by the wanka and tanka styles, followed by haiku poets of the Tokugawa period (to 1867), the subsequent modern tanka and haiku poets, and including the contemporary school of free verse––_Women Poets of Japan_ records twelve hundred years of poetic accomplishment. Included are biographical notes on the individual poets, as essay on Japanese women and literature, and a table of historical periods.
