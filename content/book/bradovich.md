Hailed by _Publishers Weekly_ as “an A-1 satire on urban living,” William Herrick’s _Bradovich_ is now available as a New Directions paperbook. Stephen Bradovich––sculptor, widower, former pro ball player, sometime brawler. Why would this complexly human, anarchist protagonist receive a visit from two impassive, square-shouldered operatives with the alarmling news: "You are under surveillance pending review, that’s the message The Authority sends you"? Praised for the compassion, humanism, and "truth-seeking" of his earlier novels, Herrick in _Bradovich_ steps beyond the "lean and muscular prose" of his terrorist trilogy (_Shadows & Wolves_, _Love & Terror_, _Kill Memory_) and beyond the working-class realism that won The Present Tense/Joel H. Cavior Award for _That’s Life_ (in 1985) to a surreal––if still recognizable––New York where suddenly not only the improbable but the impossible can happen.
