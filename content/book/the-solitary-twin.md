_John and Paul were also visitors to the town. They were twins, as identical as can be. They wore the same clothes, chino trousers and open-neck sweaters, in John’s case adorned with a faded maroon neckerchief. Both were addicted_ _to the shellfish harvested year-round from the rocks and sands of the coast:_ _little clams, winkles, cockles, crabs, and above all sea urchins–their dessert, as both said. They drank only McEwan’s India pale ale and smoked the same_ _thin black Brazilian cigars ..._

So begins the great writer Harry Mathews’s nal novel, _The Solitary Twin_, a rollicking yet incredibly moving story of two young men who come to a picturesque beach town. Seen prismatically through the viewpoints of the town's residents, they offer a variety of worldviews. Yet are they really twins or a single person?

Harry Mathews, the first American member of the French avant-garde literary society Oulipo, and long associated with the New York School of Poets, passed away this year, and _The Solitary Twin_ is his last novel. “I believe this novel is his nest,” his friend John Ashbery has declared.
