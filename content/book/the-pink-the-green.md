Among the tantalizingly unfinished works of the great French writer Stendhal (1783-1842) are the opening chapters of _The Pink & the Green_ (_Le Rose et le Vert_), which tell of the obsessions of Mina Wanghen, a young, intelligent Prussian heiress from KÃ¶nigsberg. Enamoured of everything French and determined not to be forced into marriage with any of her countless German suitors, she decamps to Paris, where her illusions meet with Gaelic realities. Stendhal abandoned the novel in 1837; however, its seeds are found in the finished story "Mina de Vanghel," completed in 1830 and published posthumously in 1853. Both works appear here side-by-side in English.
