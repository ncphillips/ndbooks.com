Here gathered in this small volume are five of the great Japanese writer Shusaku Endo’s supreme short stories exemplifying his style and his interests, presenting, as it were, Endo in a nutshell. "Unzen," the opening story, touches on the subject of _Silence_, Endo’s most famous novel––that is the torture and martyrdom of Christians in seventeenth-century Japan. Next comes “A Fifty-year-old Man" in which Mr. Chiba takes up ballroom dancing and faces the imminent death of his brother and his dog Whitey. In "Japanese in Warsaw" a business man has a strange encounter; in "The Box" an old photo album and a few postcards have a tale to reveal. Finally included is "The Case of Isobe," the opening chapter of Endo’s wonderful novel _Deep River_.
