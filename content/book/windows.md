_Windows_ is Robert Creeleyâ€™s first collection of poems since _Memory Gardens_ (1986). It marks, as its title implies, a framing of realities that is neither simply passive nor reflective. For Creeley, age and travel have served to highlight the foreignness of everyday circumstances, so that the window-passages between "inside" and "out" have become increasingly more necessary for survival.
