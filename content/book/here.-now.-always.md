_Here. Now. Always._ is the British poet Edwin Brock’s fifth book to be published in this country in as many years. It is perhaps the most intimate work thus far by this intensely personal and often acerbic writer: a memoir in prose interlaced with elucidating passages of his verse. In short episodic epiphanies, Brock reviews his bitter boyhood, his service in the British navy and on the London police force, the collapse of his first marriage. Brock, who was born in 1927, has said that he spent these early years simply “waiting for something to happen." In truth, his every breath was taken in the endless moment––“Here. Now. Always.”
