A book unlike any other, a daring experiential unfolding Spanish masterpiece, _Your Face Tomorrow_ now leaps into uncharted new territory in _Volume Two: Dance and Dream_. _Your Face Tomorrow_, Javier Marías’s dazzling unfolding magnum opus, is a novel in three parts, which began with _Volume One: Fever and Spear_ (New Directions, 2005). Described as a "brilliant dark novel" (_Scotland on Sunday_), the book now takes a wild swerve in its new volume. Skillfully constructed around a central perplexing and mesmerizing scene in a nightclub, _Volume Two: Dance and Dream_ again features Jacques Deza. In _Volume One_ he was hired by MI6 as a person of extraordinarily sophisticated powers of perception. In _Volume Two_ Deza discovers the dark side of his new employer when Tupra, his spy-master boss, brings out a sword and uses it in a way that appalls Deza: You can’t just go around hurting and killing people like that. Why not? asks Tupra. Searching meditations on favors and jealousy, knowledge and the deep human desire not to know, violence and death play against memories of the Spanish Civil War as Deza’s world becomes increasingly murky.
