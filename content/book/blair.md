In John A. Scott’s hilarious and oddly touching novel, _Blair_, we meet a memorable hero, one Eric Blair—English professor, accidental wit, bumbling would-be lover, consummate shambler, His jacket sports a carnation of food stains on his lapel, the lining long since descended in the manner of a loose petticoat; his trousers shine with dangerous neglect. Having permanently misplaced his wife in the general disorder of his life, Blair is now in stumbling pursuit of the beauteous Julia. Not since _Monty Python_ featured a group of Aussie philosophy profs swilling Foster’s and singing "Immanuel Kant is a real pissant" has academic life down under been so deftly skewered. _Blair_ is the first novel written by the prize-winning Australian poet. Formerly television comedy writer, Mr. Scott now lectures in media and resides in Melbourne.
