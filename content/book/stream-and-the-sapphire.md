Conceived as a convenience to those readers who are themselves concerned with doubt and faith, _The Stream & the Sapphire_ presents a compact thematic grouping of thirty-eight poems, originally published in seven separate volumes. The earliest poem here dates from 1978, and though the sequence is not wholly chronological, “it does,” as Denise Levertov remarks in her brief Foreword, “to some extent, trace my slow movement from agnosticism to Christian faith, a movement incorporating much of doubt and questioning as well as affirmation.”
