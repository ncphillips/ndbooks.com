This selection from representative works of the great French poet-philosopher is based on the Paris Morceaux Choisis volume, which was assembled by Valery himself. It begins with the poetry (French and English en face), including such masterpieces as "Le Cimetiêre Marin" and portions of "La Jeune Parque"; then ranges through Valery’s work in fields as various as architecture, logic, the dance, literature, philosophy, and painting. It concludes with excerpts from his creative writings such as _Monsieur Teste_ and the drama _Man Faust_. The list of translators for this volume is distinguished. Among them are Lionel Abel, Léonie Adams, Malcolm Cowley, James Kirkup, C. Day Lewis, Jackson Mathews, Louise Varèse, and Vernon Watkins.
