Basil Bunting (1900-1985) is one of the most important British poets of the twentieth century. Acknowledged since the 1930s as a major figure in Modernist poetry, first by Pound and Zukofsky, it was not until thirty years later––in 1966––that the Northumbrian master poet published _Briggflatts_, which Cyril Connolly called "the finest long poem to have been published in England since T.S. Eliot’s _Four Quartets_." In addition to _Briggflatts_ (otherwise unavailable in the U.S.), this new _Complete Poems_ includes Bunting’s other great sonatas, most notably _Villon_ (1925) and _The Spoils_ (1951), along with his two books of Odes, his vividly realized "Overdrafts" (as he called his free translations of Horace, Rudaki, and others), and also his brilliantly condensed Japanese adaptation, _Chomei at Toyama_ (1932). This edition presents the original _Collected Poems_ published earlier by Oxford University Press, with the addition of Bunting’s posthumous _Uncollected Poems_, and has an introduction by Richard Caddel, Director of the Basil Bunting Poetry Center at Durham University.
