Called “a consummate poet” by Robert Creeley and "a poet of extraordinary inventiveness, erotic energy and challenge, and ironic intelligence" by Michael Palmer, Bernadette Mayer can be found in all her variety in _Poetry State Forest_, which contains nature poems, sonnets, prose poetry, pastiches, long sequences, and epigrams.
