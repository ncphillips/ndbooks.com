Paul Hoover’s _The Novel_ is a booklength poem written in response to the author’s experience of having his first novel, _Saigon, Illinois_ (Vintage, 1988), published after a mere six months in the making. Hoover examines the privilege of the novelist from the poet’s point of view, asking in both astonishment and disappointment: why is the novelist at once the most lordly and common of authors? A mosaic in organization, the poem’s thirty parts mix, among others, Shakespeare and deconstructionist “shoptalk" with an account of Graceland when Elvis was alive and a gloss of the mass-market paperback of James M. Cain’s _The Enchanted Isle_, whose heroine Mandy appears in the poem as the fictive author’s lover. _The Novel_ presents no dichotomy between pop culture and the intensely literary, resisting closure by replicating the counterpoint speed of obsessive TV channel-changing. "The closer the look one takes at a world/the greater the distance from which it looks back."
