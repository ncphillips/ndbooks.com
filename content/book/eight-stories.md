Collected here are eight particularly enjoyable Dylan Thomas stories, stories hailed by _The New Statesman_ as "the unself-conscious classics, compassionate, fresh, and very funny... radiating enthusiasm and delight in the telling." _The Los Angeles Times_ also praised the collection: "His prose, his images, his stories all pulsate with life, with a beat and variety that captivate, invigorate and clarify... What strikes one most, finally, about these stories is their generosity. With a little distance from thier alluring world, we’re aware of Dylan Thomas mining this material from inside his self, excavating, polishing, and setting it asparkle before us."
