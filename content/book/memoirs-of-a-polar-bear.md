_Memoirs of a Polar Bear_ stars three generations of talented writers and performers. Famous stars of the literary world, the circus, and the zoo, they happen to be polar bears who move human society. In part one, the matriarch, enjoying "the intimacy of being alone with my pen," accidentally writes a bestselling autobiography in the Soviet Union. In part two, her daughter Tosca moves to East Germany and pioneers a thrilling circus act. And Tosca's son—the last of their line—<span class="redactor-invisible-space">is Knut, born in part three and raised by a human keeper in relatively happy circumstances in the Berlin zoo.</span>
