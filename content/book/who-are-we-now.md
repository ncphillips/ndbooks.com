"Do you enjoy your own mind? Maxims and legends of total reality, echoing and re-echoing there?" asks Lawrence Ferlinghetti in discussing this, his seventh book of verse. "If we could only decipher it… Visual beatitudes, landscapes of living and dying flashed upon the dark screen…” The poems in _Who Are We Now?_, truly "landscapes of living," are naturally attempts to decipher that reality, ranging eclectically from the populist to the esoteric, from Bob Dylan to Gustav Klimt to the already famous "Populist Manifesto," which the late jazz critic Ralph Gleason characterized as an "important document of the Seventies."
