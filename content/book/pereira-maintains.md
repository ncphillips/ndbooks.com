Dr. Pereira is an aging, overweight, mostly lonely living the sunny life of an aesthete and gourmand<span class="st">—</span>even while the menacing cloud of Fascism hangs over Salazarist Lisbon. He escapes facing the ominous times by translating French stories for a newspaper's weekly culture page. "Are you living another world?" his exasperated friend Father Antonio asks him. "For goodness's sake go and find out what's happening around you." When Pereira meets a young anti-Fascist writer, he is forced to break out of the shell of his own inhibitions.

"Tabucchi expertly chronicles Pereira's ascent to consciousness," wrote _Publishers Weekly_ in a starred review. And it is his reluctant awakening that gives the novel its delightful, heroic power.
