_The Theatre of Tennessee Williams_ brings together in matching format the plays of one of America’s most persistently influential and innovative dramatists. Arranged in chronological order, this ongoing series includes the original cast listings and production notes for all full-length plays. Now available as a New Directions Paperbook, _Volume IV_ contains a wonderfully diverse collection of Williams’s works. _Sweet Bird of Youth_ (1959) is a dramatic study of a fading Hollywood actress, who tries to recapture her youth through a young drifter half her age. In a lighter mood, _Period of Adjustment_ (1960) tells of the marital troubles of two "Middle American couples, a departure for the playwright who himself labeled it a ’serious comedy.’" _The Night of the Iguana_ (1961), in sharp contrast, tells of human frailty and redemptive strength on the West Coast of Mexico.
