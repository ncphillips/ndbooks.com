This new collection of fantastic, lesser-known one-acts contains some of Williams’s most potent, comical and disturbing short plays―Upper East Side ladies dine out during the apocalypse in _Now the Cats With Jeweled Claws_, while the poet Hart Crane is confronted by his mother at the bottom of the ocean in _Steps Must Be Gentle._ Five previously unpublished plays include _A Recluse and His Guest_, and _The Strange Play_,in which we witness a woman’s entire life lived within a twenty-four-hour span. This volume is edited, with an introduction and notes, by the editor, acting teacher, and theater scholar Thomas Keith.
