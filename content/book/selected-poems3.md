Acclaiming the late Eugenio Montale (1897-1981) as "one of the most important poets of the contemporary West," the Swedish Academy awarded him the 1975 Nobel Prize for Literature. This selection, introduced by Glauco Cambon, presents sixty-nine poems chosen from Montale’s first three books––_Ossi di seppia_ (_Cuttlefish Bones_), _Le occasioni_ (_The Occasions_), and _La bufera e altro_ (_The Storm and Other Things_)––as rendered by sixteen translators, many of them distinguished poets in their own right.
