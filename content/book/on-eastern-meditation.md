Merton’s biographer, George Woodcock, once wrote that "almost from the beginning of his monastic career, Thomas Merton tentatively began to discover the great Asian religions of Buddhism and Taoism." Merton, a longtime social justice advocate, first approached Eastern theology as an admirer of Gandhi’s beliefs on non-violence. Through Gandhi, Merton came to know the great Hindu text, _Bhagavad Git_a and in time came to have dialogues with the Dalai Lama and Taoist leader D. T. Suzuki. Merton then became deeply interested in Chuang Tzu and Zen thought. _On Eastern Meditation_, edited by Bonnie Thurston (author of _Merton and Buddhism_), gathers the best of his Eastern theological writings into a gorgeously designed gift book edition.
