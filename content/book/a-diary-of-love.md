In _A Diary of Love_, Maude Hutchins introduces us to Noel. Noel is an orphan being raised by a flute-playing grandfather, a spinster aunt, a benign family doctor, an incredible cook, an improbable governess, and the neighbors, who are gamey. Between a country estate and a sanitarium in the desert, _A Diary of Love_ highlights the capriciousness of Noel and her capability to love a vast array of characters. Hutchinsâ€™ probing, darting, fantasy-building mind is ever on the move through space, time, history, dreams, and delighted memories.
