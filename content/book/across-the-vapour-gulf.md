In Will Alexander’s work, “Every poem reads like a subversive, alchemical wonder. He is truly a singular voice” (Jackson Poetry Prize citation). Inspired by Cioran’s aphorisms and composed over the span of thirty years, _Across the Vapour Gulf_ opens with a note by the poet: “Reading Cioran opened an unexpected neural pathway, opening the way for the composition of the compilation at hand. Each entry was instantaneous. They welled up and appeared with such astonishing alacrity, that they seemed to compose themselves practically fully formed.”
