In addition to substantial new work, Allen Grossman in _The Ether Dome and Other Poems New and Selected 1979-1991_ gives his readers a retrospective of a life in poetry that has brought him such honors as a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Witter Bynner Prize of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and a MacArthur Fellowship. _The Ether Dome_ is his seventh book of poems.
