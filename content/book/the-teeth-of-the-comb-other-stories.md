_Some of the teeth of the comb were envious of the class differences that exist between humans. They strived desperately to increase their height, and, when they succeeded, began to look with disdain on their colleagues below._

_After a little while the comb’s owner felt a desire to comb his hair. But when he found the comb in this state he threw it in the garbage._

From Osama Alomar, a brilliant Syrian writer living in exile in Pittsburgh, come these wonderful stories populated by personified swords and snakes and swamps, wolves and zeroes and rainbows. In _The Teeth of the Comb_ they aspire, they plot, they hope, they destroy, they fail. But they always animate new realities<span class="st">—and make us see our realities anew. Reading Alomar's sly moral fables and sharp political allegories, we sit up a little straighter and a little wiser.</span>
