This exciting new collection, _My Floating Mother, City_, contains poems from Kazuko Shiraishi’s most recent books published in Japan, including _The Running of the Full Moon_ (2004) and _My Floating Mother, City_ (2003), which received the Bansui Poetry Award and a Cultural Award from the Emperor of Japan. Three amazing long sequences, including “Sendai Metro, Greece Street,” are here translated into English for the first time.
