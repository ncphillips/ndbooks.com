First published in 1975, and available now as a New Directions Paperbook, George Oppen’s _Collected Poems_ brings together the work of one of our foremost contemporary poets, winner of the 1969 Pulitzer Prize. A member of the Objectivist school that flourished in the 1930s (which also included William Carlos Williams, Charles Reznikoff, Carl Rakosi, and Louis Zukofsky), he was hailed by Ezra Pound as "a serious craftsman, a sensibility which is not every man’s sensibility and which has not been got out of any other man’s books." Contained in the present volume are Oppen’s late poems, _Myth of the Blaze_ (1972-1975), as well as all of _Discrete Series_ (1934), _The Materials_ (1962), _This in Which_ (1965), _Of Being Numerous_ (1968), and _Seascape: Needle’s Eye_ (1972).
