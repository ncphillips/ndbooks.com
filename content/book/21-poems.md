The Objectivist Press published George Oppen’s first book, _Discrete Series_, in 1934. Four years earlier, the twenty-one-year-old poet had sent an unbound sheaf of typewritten poems with the title _21 Poems_ handwritten in pencil on the first page to Louis Zukofsky, who forwarded them on to Ezra Pound in Paris. These poems, suffused with Oppen’s love for his young bride Mary, as well as his love of sailing, are strikingly unique. The scholar David B. Hobbs recently found _21 Poems_ buried in Pound’s papers at Yale’s Beinecke Library, and it appears here as a collection for the first time.
