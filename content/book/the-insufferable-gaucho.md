As Pankaj Mishra remarked in _The Nation_, one of the remarkable qualities of Bolaño’s short stories is that they can do the "work of a novel." _The Insufferable Gaucho_ contains tales bent on returning to haunt you. Unpredictable and daring, highly controlled yet somehow haywire, a Bolaño story might concern an elusive plagiarist or an elderly lawyer giving up city life for an improbable return to the family estate, now gone to wrack and ruin. Bolaño’s stories have been applauded as "bleakly luminous and perfectly calibrated" (_Publishers Weekly_) and "complex and provocative (_International Herald Tribune_), and as Francine Prose said in _The New York Times Book Review_, "something extraordinarily beautiful and (at least to me) entirely new." Two fascinating essays are also included.
