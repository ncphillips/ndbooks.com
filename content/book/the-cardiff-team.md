Guy Davenport’s story collection _A Table of Green Fields_ (New Directions, 1993) was praised for its amazing artistry and "stratospheric" literary intelligence (_Kirkus Reviews_). As _The Washington Post_ noted, "It draws one in with its austere, beautifully formal sentences, its rich pattern of memory." In Davenport’s follow-up collection, _The Cardiff Team_, the stories continue in this vein, their texts a wondrous collage of persons, events, and ideas from cultural history. The central theme is that of tribeless people joining, or trying to join, a team, a tribe, or a society. In "The Messengers," Franz Kafka visits the Jungborn Health Spa in the Harz mountains and tries to feel comfortable in his own skin. In "Boys Smell Like Oranges," a soccer team of boys from Henry de Montherlant’s _Les Olympiques_ is its own contained tribe. _The Cardiff Team_ perfectly displays Guy Davenport’s illustrious prose and his audacity; confirming _The New Yorker_’s assertion that his is "among the very few, truly original voices now audible in American letters."
