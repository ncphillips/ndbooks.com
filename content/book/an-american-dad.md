In this fresh and intriguing biography/memoir, William Eric Williams reveals the true character of an iconic American poet. With quotations from intimate family letters and diaries, William Eric offers a penetrating portrait of William Carlos, not only as a father, but in relation to his own parents, his architect brother, and especially his indispensable, much loved wife, Flossie. Many rare photographs accompany the texts.
