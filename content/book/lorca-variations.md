As poet and experimental translator, pioneer in performance poetry and ethnopoetics, Jerome Rothenberg for over three decades has been a literary radical and prominent influence in the American avant-garde. Among his own earliest sources was the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca, whose "composition through images ... opened my mind to the contemporary poetry of Europe & of something possibly older & deeper that would surface for us in America as well." Having recently returned to translating Lorca, Rothenberg began to appropriate and rearrange items of Lorca’s vocabulary and to compose a series of poems of his own that "both are & aren’t mine, both are & aren’t Lorca.” As an original work, _The Lorca Variations_ are, as he describes them, "a way of coming full circle into a discovery that began with Lorca & for which he has stood with certain others as a guide & constant fellow-traveler."
