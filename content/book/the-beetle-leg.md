_The Beetle Leg_, John Hawkes’s second full-length novel, was first published by New Directions in 1951. Now, after more than fifteen years of underground existence, this brilliant novel is emerging as a classic of visionary writing and still remains Hawkes’s only work devoted solely to American life. As a ’surrealist Western" (_Newsweek_), and a violent and poetic portrayal of "a landscape of sexual apathy" (Albert J. Guerard), _The Beetle Leg_ is a rich flight into the special vein of comedy that Hawkes had begun to exploit a decade before the popular acceptance of "black humor."
