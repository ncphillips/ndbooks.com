Rosmarie Waldrop’s _Curves to the Apple_ brings together three highly praised and influential titles: _The Reproduction of Profiles_, _Lawn of Excluded Middle_, and _Reluctant Gravities_. Though originally published separately, these prose poems have always been intended as a loose trilogy of thought and feeling—or of thought manifested as feeling. The author comments: "Just as the title, _Curves to the Apple_, combines the organic and geometry (not to mention myth and history of science) the poems navigate the conflicting, but inextricable claims of body and mind, especially the female body and feelings in a space of logic and physics. The poems could all be called dialogic, reaching out across a synaptic (sometimes humorous) gap to a possible ’you’ (though it may be rhetorical, another point of view in the same mind). But while the ’I’ dominates the first two volumes, the third gives both voices equal space and chance."
