In her first full-length collection published in the United States, Sylvia Legris probes and peels, carves and cleaves, amputates and dissects, to reveal the poetic potential of human and animal anatomy.

Starting with the Greek writings of Hippocrates and the Latin language of medicine, and drawing from Leonardo da Vinci’s _Anatomical Manuscripts_, the dermatologist Robert Willan’s _On Cutaneous Diseases_ (1808), and Baudelaire’s _The Flowers of Evil_, Legris infuses each poem with unique rhythms that roll off the tongue. _The Hideous Hidden_ boldly celebrates anatomy’s wonders: “Renounce the vestibule of non-vital vitals. / Confess the gallbladder, / the glandular wallflowers, / the objectionable oblong spleen."
