_The Europe of Trusts_ contains three brilliant, long-unavailable books which Susan Howe first published in the early 1980s: _The Liberties_, _Pythagorean Silence_, and _Defenestration of Prague_. These are the landmark books––following her volumes from the previous decade (_Hinge Picture_, _Chanting at the Crystal Sea_, _Cabbage Gardens_, and _Secret History of the Dividing Line_)––which established Howe as "one of America’s foremost experimental writers" (_Publishers Weekly_). "Her work," as Geoffrey O’Brien put it, "is a voyage of reconnaissance in language, a sounding out of ancient hiding places, and it is a voyage full of risk. ’Words are the only clues we have,’ she has said. ‘What if they fail us?’"
