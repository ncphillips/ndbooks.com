The miscellany of essays, notes, fragments, and jottings to which William Carlos Williams gave the title _The Embodiment of Knowledge_ was found in manuscript after his death in the archive of his papers at the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Written in 1928-30, and dedicated to his sons, it was intended as a concrete demonstration of the organic nature of education, to show that knowledge is an ongoing process by which we create our selves from day to day. And to underscore the fact that so many of his own books were extended works of self-exploration, Dr. Williams wrote on the cover of his manuscript: "to be printed as it is, faults and all."
