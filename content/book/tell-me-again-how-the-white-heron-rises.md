_Tell Me Again How the White Heron Rises and Flies Across the Nacreous River at Twilight Toward the Distant Islands_ is Hayden Carruth’s fourth book of poetry with New Directions. This is a full and rich collection which has been separated into two parts. Part one offers a varied wealth of poems, remarkable as always for their meditative powers and for their "principled alertness..." (_NYTBR_). The seccond part is one long poem, "Mother," a work of fierce emotion addressing the long life and slow torturous death of Carruth’s own mother.
