_Black Mesa Poems_ is rooted in the American Southwest, the setting of Jimmy Santiago Baca’s highly acclaimed long narrative poem, _Martin & Meditations on the South Valley_ (New Directions, 1987). "Baca’s evocation of this landscape," as _City Paper_ noted, "its aridity and fertility, is nothing short of brilliant." The individual poems of _Black Mesa_ are embedded both in the family and in the community life of the barrio, detailing births and deaths, neighbors and seasons, injustices and victories. Loosely interconnected, the poems trace a visionary biography of place.
