William Carlos Williams’s place among the great poets of our century is firmly established. This anthology of selections drawn from the whole range of his work––poetry, fiction, autobiography, drama and essays––shows conclusively that his prose was also remarkably original, versatile and powerful. It has been edited by M. L. Rosenthal, literary critic and Professor of English at New York University.
