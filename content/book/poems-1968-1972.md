Denise Levertov’s _Poems 1968-1972_ gathers together all the poems from _Relearning the Alphabet_ (1970), _To Stay Alive_ (1971), and _Footprints_ (1972). Testifying to Levertov’s growing strength and technical mastery as a poet, _Poems 1968-1972_ also affirms the clarity of her vision in its resistance to the Vietnam War and its "opposition to the whole system of insane greed of which war is only the inevitable expression."
