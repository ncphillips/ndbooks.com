Some of the most rewarding pages in Henry Miller’s books concern his self-education as a writer. He tells, as few great writers ever have, how he set his goals, how he discovered the excitement of using words, how the books he read influenced him, and how he learned to draw on his own experience. For this collection––which should be invaluable to young writers––Thomas H. Moore, co-founder of the Henry Miller Literary Society, brought together, with Miller’s active collaboration, the most revealing passages on the art and practice of writing. A number of them are from unpublished manuscripts; there are private notations, writing schedules, outlines of ideas.
