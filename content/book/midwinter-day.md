_Midwinter Day_ was written on December 22, 1978 at 100 Main Street, in Lennox, Massachusettes. "_Midwinter Day,_" as Alice Notley noted, "is an epic poem about a daily routine." A poem in six parts, _Midwinter Day_ takes us from awakening and emerging from dreams through the whole day-morning, afternoon, evening, night-to dreams again: ". . . a plain introduction to modes of love and reason / Then to end I guess with love, a method to this winter season / Now I’ve said this love it’s all I can remember / Of Midwinter Day the twenty-second of December."
