One of a trilogy of novellas addressing the theme of women in extramarital affairs, _Brocade Valley_ shocked China when it appeared in 1987, becoming a bestseller and effectively dynamiting the sexual puritanism of official Chinese writing. It is only in _Brocade Valley_, the third and most controversial of the series, that the sexually adventurous woman is not punished for her activities. On the contrary, she is awarded a highly modern prize: a new sense of self which enables her to author her own story, the story of a young married editor who has a passing but liberating affair with a famous writer. Wang Anyi brings to her heroine the device of a triple perspective - narrator, protagonist, projection. The special interior tone which results, pitched to Wang Anyi’s delicately circling style, allows the reader an intimate, insider’s eye-view of a surprising China and creates a resonant novella of unusual beauty.
