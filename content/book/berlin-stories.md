_The Berlin Stories_ is a book comprising two short novels by Christopher Isherwood: _Goodbye to Berlin_ and _The Last of Mr. Norris_. The two novellas are set in Berlin in 1931, just as Adolf Hitler was moving into power. Berlin is portrayed by Isherwood during this transitional period of cafes and quaint avenues, grotesque nightlife and dreamers, and powerful mobs and millionaires. Sally Bowles is the protagonist who experiences her share of misadventures along with Mr. Norris, Fr√§ulein Schroeder, and the Landauers. _The Berlin Stories_ was the starting point for the John Van Druten play _I Am a Camera_, which in turn went on to inspire the film _I Am a Camera_ as well as the stage musical and film versions of _Cabaret_.
