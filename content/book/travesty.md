_Travesty_ is John Hawkes’s most extreme vision of eroticism and comic terror. In the south of France, an elegant sportscar is speeding through the night, bearing a man, his daughter, and his best friend toward a fatal crash. As he drives, the "privileged man" justifies, in sustained monologue, his firm persuasion that willed destruction is the ultimate act of the poetic imagination. "What I have in mind is an ’accident’ so perfectly contrived that it will be unique, spectacular and instantaneous, a physical counterpart to that vision in which it was in fact conceived." This is the final work in a triad of novels concerned with sex, myth, the imagination, and the absurd. _The Blood Oranges_ (1971) is the acting out of a lyric dream; _Death, Sleep & The Traveler_ (1974) a descent into the depths of psychic darkness to the edge of death; and _Travesty_ (1976) an icily comic portrait of the poet as suicide and murderer. It is one of the most cruelly and brilliantly ironic works to be found in contemporary literature.
