"The short dirk in the hands of Muriel Spark has always been a deadly weapon." said _The New York Times_, and "never more so than in _The Abbess of Crewe_." An elegant little fable about intrigue, corruption, and electronic surveillance, _The Abbess of Crewe_ (1974) is set in an English Benedictine convent. Steely and silky Abbess Alexandra (whose aristocratic tastes run to pâté, fine wine, English poetry, and carpets of "amorous green") has bugged the convent, and rigged her election. But the cat gets out of the bag, and — plunged into scandal — the serene Abbess faces a Vatican inquiry.
