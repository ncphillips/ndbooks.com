Allman's voice [in Walking Four Ways in the Wind] has a range of many octaves which provides this collection with a variety of tones... Allman's imagination is capable of startling maneuvers, but he always holds to the tracks of the poem's subject. He is like one of those specialized pilots at airshows who can fly upside down but close to the ground.
