It is a rare gift, to be offered a writer who lives in our own time but speaks with the intensity of the past, who comes with the extra richness lent by a foreign history and nonetheless knows our own culture inside out. Yet, strangely, Javier Marías––who is famous in Spain and garlanded with prizes from the rest of Europe––remains almost unknown in America. What are we waiting for?
