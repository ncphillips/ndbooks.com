His latest book to be translated, *Ema the Captive*, is not only one of his earliest books—it may be his finest. As such, it also works as a perfect introduction to the Aira universe. The world of *Ema* is lush and fantastic, but never overbearing; the reader is immersed in a landscape still teetering on the edge of innocence, awash with animals and scents almost impossible to imagine in our modern times. From body-painting to lantern-lit caves to the mating of manatees, the world that Ema—and the lucky reader—inhibit is wondrous and new, even if it’s the imagined past.
