Reading Kilito for me has always been a kind of adventure. We normally speak of writing as an adventure, but Kilito dares his reader to travel with him, on a quest to override the boundaries between reality and fiction, between literary criticism and storytelling. *The Clash of Images* is a marvelous book. Its power lies in its ability to create a magical relation between storytelling and critical thought.
