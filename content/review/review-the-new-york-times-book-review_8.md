This little book of letters beautifully expresses the real Miller, the Henry- san his friends knew - genius and tummler, savant and buffoon, raconteur, aphorist, wise man, clown. It is a pleasure to have it ... reveals the essential Miller - booklover, wordlover, anarchist and champion of the underdog, the vagabond and the poet.
