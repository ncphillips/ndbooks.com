Raduan Nassar burst onto the Brazilian literary scene in the 1970s with a pair of novels that launched a bitter grenade directly into the heart of the upper and middle classes. *A Cup of Rage*—long overdue in English—takes place over a few days on a remote farm, as a pair of lovers stormily interact.
