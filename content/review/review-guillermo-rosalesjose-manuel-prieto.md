Very little is known about how an unknown writer like Guillermo Rosales came to be the writer of excellence who appears here, the possessor of a unique style and the author of what is, without a doubt, one of the best Cuban novels of the second half of the twentieth century, comparable only to the mythical Carlos Montenegro's *Men Without Women* or Reinaldo Arenas's famous memoir *Before Night Falls*
