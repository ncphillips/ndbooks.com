[Roger] Williams's *A Key into the Language of America* was the first extensive vocabulary and study of an Indian language printed in English. Waldrop's *Key* is a return and a reinscription. She...intersplices, turns, overturns, plots, weaves and threads, line for line, at least three structural system...Waldrop's *A Key* is a witty, and deeply moving, translation of sexual and textual division and witness.
