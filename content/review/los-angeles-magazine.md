Russian cosmonauts, a waterfall-obsessed interpreter in Shanghai teetering on the edge of sanity, and a Portuguese child laborer who escapes his toils by wandering into an alternate reality ... _The World Goes On_ \[is\] a philosophically-charged new collection of stories about characters that are being pushed (figuratively or literally) to the edges of the world.
