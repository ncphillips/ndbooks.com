In *Counternarratives*, John Keene undertakes a kind of literary counterarchaeology, a series of fictions that challenge our notion of what constitutes “real” or “accurate” history. His writing is at turns playful and erudite, lyric and coldly diagnostic, but always completely absorbing. *Counternarratives* could easily be compared to Borges or Bolaño, Calvino or Kiš
