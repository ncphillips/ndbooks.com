Reznikoff's poems project an attitude which has uncanny significance for us today. Even those that are now 20 or 30 years old are peculiarly contemporary, being solely concerned with lucidity of vision. Naked of ornament, clean of illusion, they show us 'the iron scythe in the grass that stops for no flower.'
