*The Poetry of Thought* is denser in its language, more disquieting in its arguments, more in line with Steiner’s stronger works, such as *Heidegger* and many of the essays collected in *No Passion Spent* Steiner’s overall subject here is the interlocked nature of poetic language and philosophical thought, and how the intellect manifests itself through this connection.
