We find this hall-of-mirrors construction in Uwe Johnson, Peter Handke and others. But Andersch manipulates it with an ease and unpretentiousness that are seductively disorienting, until the reader himself is dissolved into that bittersweet sigh, in equal measure humorous and despairing, that is *Efraim's Book*
