What appeals to me most about [McClure’s] poems is the fury and the imagery of them. I love the vividness of his reactions and the very personal turns and swirls of the lines. The worlds in which I myself live, the private world of personal reactions, the biological world (animals and plants and even bacteria chase each other through the poems), the world of the atom and the molecule, the stars and galaxies, are all there: and in between, above and below, stands man, the howling mammal, contrived out of ‘meat’ by chance and necessity.
