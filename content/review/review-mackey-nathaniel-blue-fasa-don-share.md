Nathaniel Mackey's poetry ambitiously continues an American bardic line that unfolds from *Leaves of Grass* to Pound's *Cantos* to H.D.'s *Trilogy*, winds through the whole of Robert Duncan's work, and extends beyond all of these. Mackey's own rare combinations create an astonishing and resounding effect: his words go where music goes: a brilliant and major accomplishment.
