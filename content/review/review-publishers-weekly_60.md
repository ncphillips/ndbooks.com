One of the very few writers to achieve enduring fame as a translator, [Cole] looks at the long, international history of Jewish literature, the modern enterprise of translation, the troubled contexts of his Middle East, as well as marital love ... Anyone with any interest in Cole's topics will cherish this admirable book.
