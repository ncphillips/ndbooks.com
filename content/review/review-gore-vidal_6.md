Emma Tennant's memoir reads like the account of a young girl's dream––a castle, secret rooms, overheard conversations, a brilliant harried prime minister and his formidable wife, Margot Asquith, as well as an entire generation of prince charmings alive, one moment, on old lawns, and next gone in the First War, ghosts in the attics.
