This novel is "doubly translated" in the sense that Yoko Tawada first wrote it in Japanese and then translated it herself into German, from whence it was recrafted into English. It even boasts an additional layer of translating, as it were, since the first part of the book is narrated by a Russian-speaking bear. The story itself follows three generations of polar bears across the world in a powerful tale of both family and isolation.
