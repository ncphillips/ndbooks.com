Susan Howe's *Pierce-Arrow* is a true and living poem—more philosophical then history, without ceasing to be history—and more lyric than philosophical in its visiting of the buried life of the most passionate American philosopher. Howe's Peirce is a successor to *her* Emily Dickinson and, as such, a further chapter in her own right, and her book—*Pierce-Arrow*—is also a fast car with a fantasmatic shift—the *mind* as it desires to know—the *body* which by its nature holds the road—and carries the heart elsewhere—beyond destination. *Peace thereafter/Rest fathom over*.
