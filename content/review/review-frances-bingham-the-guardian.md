Valentine Ackland's poetic voice, lyrical, powerful, melancholy yet life-affirming, surprises by speaking of lesbian love, the socialist struggle, natural beauty, the spiritual world and the evil of war. She achieved heroism of a quiet kind by writing what she believed in, as though it mattered, and as a result her poetry is still vital 100 years after her birth.
