By marrying domestic realism with the literature of the bizarre, Ingalls brings tenderness to the monstrous and renders the recognizable utterly weird. Compact yet capacious, the novel wonders at all the ways we can desire and destroy one another. Itâ€™s unabashedly campy and deadly serious; it dares the reader to admit that these aims are not at all at odds.
