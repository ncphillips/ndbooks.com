A sprawling, gently satirical collection of linked tale within tales, Yousufi’s novel is a hymn to the chaotic lives of India’s Muslims…Rich with allusions to Western and Muslim culture, philosophical asides, and poetic couplets, Yousufi’s text brims with the collected wisdom of generations. He treats the persistent ache of nostalgia for a long-gone world with its only effective salve: laughter.
