Toby Olson proves a writer of remarkable range and capability, and these poems join the established situation of his prose to make a singular human articulation of those inner lives we lead in this world of adamantly 'outside' reality. Haunting as recollection, provocative as familiar feelings must always be, there is no end to the preoccupations of these texts. Like the old songs they often invoke, there is always more said, and more to say.
