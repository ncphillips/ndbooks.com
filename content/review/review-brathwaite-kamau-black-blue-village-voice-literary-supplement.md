The printed word doesn't rise much closer to singing than in the work of Barbadian troubadour Kamau Brathwaite... Brathwaite's voice is as fierce as it is musical. He charges words with unmistakable voltage, and brands them on our tongues. Perched as we are between an Old World Order and the New, this is just the kind of poetry Williams had in mind when he said that men die for the lack of what is to be found there.
