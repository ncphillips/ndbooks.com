Although often analyzed as a poetry of ideas—Wittgenstein in verse—Palmer’s is in fact intensely somatic, gestural…Always in Palmer one gets the feeling of the language trying to get outside by undoing itself, by unraveling the complex fabric of language to feel its threads, yes, but perhaps also to see through it to what is behind and beyond it .... ‘Did they really run out of things/or was it only the names for things/in that radical sublimity, that/daubed whiteness, final /cleansing and kindness perfect/snow or perfection of snow//leaving us peering at the bridge.’ At Passages leaves us peering at the bridge, at what we don’t yet know. But it has gotten us to the bridge, to a going-on. And in these cursed times, that is a singular achievement.
