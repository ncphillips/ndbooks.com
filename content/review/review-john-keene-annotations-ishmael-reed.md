When I first read John Keene's fiction, almost a decade ago at Harvard, I knew immediately that I was in the presence of genius. With his work *Annotations*, Mr. Keene, after years of woodshedding and apprenticeships, has fulfilled that early promise. These poetic meditations about private lives and public events are brilliant, polished and of considerable depth.
