The letters [of Analyzing Freud] reveal two complicated, appealing, highly intelligent women; give us a sense of Vienna at a time of great political upheaval and danger; and present Freud in close-up, as observed by the awed yet canny H.D…. Susan Stanford Friedman proves herself to be an excellent editor––scrupulous and thorough.
