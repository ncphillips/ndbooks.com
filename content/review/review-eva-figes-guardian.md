*Luck*, translated by Gert Hofmann's son, Michael, is a wonderful book, combining a light touch with underlying pathos, ironic humour with real empathy for the heartbreak of ordinary lives...The kid sister is one of the most memorable depictions of early childhood it has ever been my pleasure to read.
