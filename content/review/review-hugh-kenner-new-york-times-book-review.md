At long last, in his sixty-eighth year, George Oppen's work can be had in one volume instead of five-plus: twenty-four pages of new poems, annexed to a handsome resetting of the earlier books. Those were thin books, and participation in the bulk of a single volume now changes the import of every poem. The first sequence dates from 1934. All those years, academe (alas) is about to discover, an Oeuvre has been growing.
