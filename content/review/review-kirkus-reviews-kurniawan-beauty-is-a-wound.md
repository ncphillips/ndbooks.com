Kurniawan sets the stage for an epic picaresque that's equal parts _Canterbury Tales_ and _Mahabharata_. Weaving back in forth in time, moving from character to character, the author tells the story of Indonesia from its Dutch colonial days, through the Japanese occupation during World War II, and into independence as a modern state. Huge ambition, abundantly realized.
