Nobody knows how to do so much with so few words as Corman. And Nothing Doing is rich with his austerities, poems full of wisdom and tenderness and absurdities. It's a book that seems to have come from every time in the man's life, as if all his times were in his custody at once. It feels to me like the summa poetica of Corman's work, where he stands up to be counted. And shows the power and grace of what he does so well.
