Throughout his career as a very prolific poet and editor he has been a pioneer and has manifested a daring dynamic sensibility that has brought the innovative excitement of contemporary painting and sculpture to poetry.... His new book, A Seneca Journal, is patently an important and exciting work and another significant contribution by a remarkable poet, Jerome Rothenberg.
