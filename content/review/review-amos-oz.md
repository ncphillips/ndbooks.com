Yoel Hoffmann is one of the most precious voices in Israel's contemporary literature: his writing has about it the poetic, dream-like quality of an ancient myth, combined with a fierce, 'molecular' precision. Reading Hoffmann's subtle prose is like viewing the same universe, alternately and with the most skillful modulations, through a telescope and a microscope, only to find out, in awe, that the astral view and the infinitesimal view are actually one and the same.
