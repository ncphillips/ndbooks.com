Keeneâ€™s latest triumph...relentlessly bombards the reader with highbrow musings and skilful literary finesse. This work is an insatiable pursuit of racial recognition and redemption which ultimately develops into a galactic investigation into human nature itself, all the while sustaining the control and measure indicative of an accomplished writer, and a perspicacious mind.
