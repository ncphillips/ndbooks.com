What Mr. Cohen has is his own: a joy in language, and an eye, at once innocent and shrewd, for the paradoxes inherent in the human condition. He puts both language and people through their paces, stands them on their heads, and hugs them to his heart in what amounts to a tour de force of serio comedy, a sort of superb clowning in which pathos and absurdity intertwine as they do in a Chaplin
film.
