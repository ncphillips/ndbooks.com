Like Hesiod's famed work from nearly three millennia ago, Mayer's diaristic book-length poem addresses matters of corruption and injustice, contemplates nature and housekeeping, and dips in and out of mythological imagery. That the collection is written in a freewheeling, humorous and exceedingly casual tone makes the profundity of Mayer's observations all the more striking.
