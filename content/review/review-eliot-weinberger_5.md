A child who paid for the political sins of her grandparents in Hoxha's Albania; a young poet who seems to have been writing for a hundred years in a language that's only been written for a hundred years; an erotic lyricist in the ruins of a state; Luljeta Lleshanaku is the real thing, and as unexpected as an oasis behind a mountain on the moon.
