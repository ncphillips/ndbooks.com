With its piston-driven lyric breath, its animal empathy, its astonishing and then again astonishing formal inventiveness, Thalia Field's new book leads the reader by the ear to participate in the birth of a literature so radically expressive, energetic, and transformative, its instance is singular and singularly important ... It is unflaggingly brilliant.
