*Blue Fasa* asks what the lyric can give us, and answers in an immense and generous manner. In Mackey's music, we viscerally feel the physicality of language as well as the history and feeling encoded in it. It would be a loss for contemporary poetry to forget that sensuous shuttle of syllables from tongue to sound wave.
