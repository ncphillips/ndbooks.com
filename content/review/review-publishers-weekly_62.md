As in her poetry, Levertov's descriptions and characterizations can be flawless; her ability to relate an incident is at once timeless and immediate, boundless and searingly personal. 'These tesserae have no pretensions,' Levertov notes. She is right--these lovely, lyrical remembrances are too true and spare ever to invite such criticism.
