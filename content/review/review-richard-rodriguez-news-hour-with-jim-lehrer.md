The best advice I ever got as a writer I got from Saroyan in the preface to his wonderful collection, The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze. I pass it along to you, to any young writer, whatever the age, who might need the reminder. Saroyan wrote: 'The most solid advice for a writer is this, I think: Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep really to sleep. Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell.'
