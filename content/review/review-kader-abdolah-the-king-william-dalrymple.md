*The King* is utterly fabulous in both senses of the word: a sly, witty, knowing fable, full of charm and humor. Deceptively simple in its storytelling, it reads like one of Angela Carter's fairy tales transposed into the nineteenth-century Qajar Persian court. Kader Abdolah is a masterful and completely addictive storyteller.
