Bolano's febrile narrative tack and occasional surreal touches bring to mind the classics of Latin American magic realism his cerebral protagonist and nonfiction borrowings are reminiscent of Thomas Bernhard and W.G. Sebald. The novel, Bola√±o's first to be translated into English, is at once occasion for celebration.
