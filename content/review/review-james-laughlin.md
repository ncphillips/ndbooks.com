Each time, with each new book, there was a new creation. The only repetitions were those imposed by the physical media. I often wish that Lustig had chosen to be a painter. It is sad to think that so many of his designs must live in hiding on the sides of books on shelves. I would like to have his beautiful*Mallarme* crystal or his *Nightwood* abstraction on my living room wall.
