Somewhere between a cutting-edge film and a 1002nd night of storytelling, interspersed with drawings and calligraphy, Dunya Mikhail's new poems reframe, in a contemporary woman's voice, the great poet al-Sayab's cry from the heart: 'Iraq, Iraq, nothing but Iraq!' Here, myth alleviates the exile's longing, and exilic longin itself opens the poet's eyes to broad horizons.
