DrndiÄ‡'s depiction of psychologist and writer Andreas Ban is so vivid one starts to look for more writing by him. Ban's utterly candid, open-eyed, no-holds-barred assessment of his own life, looking back at loves and colleagues, at what happened in Croatia and elsewhere in Europe during hideous, dark turbulent times leaves one in awe.
