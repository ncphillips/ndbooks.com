Readers not befuddled by the twists and turns Vila-Matas packs into a few pages are likely to be enchanted by narrators who are never quite trustworthy (‘I treated other people’s memories as mine, and that is why I can now boast of having had a life’), offbeat setups, and brilliant language. Odd stories with a bite: cynical, funny, and often puzzling.
