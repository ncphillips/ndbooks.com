*Khurbn*, Jerome Rothenberg's precisely personal, horrifying, tender, and structurally astute masterpiece, is the great middle-length (40 pages) poem of our times. The Jewish agony in the Nazi killing centers has been researched, testified to, and documented; *Khurbn* is the first poem I know of to engage this agony emotionally, intellectually, and imaginatively. Hearing Rothenberg read it two years ago, I felt the eels of the brutalized, invisible for forty-five years, begin to move under my skin.
