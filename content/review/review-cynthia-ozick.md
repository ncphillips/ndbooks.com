Frederick Busch's work has the traditional strengths of human sympathy which are instantly recognizable as the whole life of the novel; and at the same time he is of that active party which means to make-it-new. The combination releases one from jadedness, and brings us close to a surprise; coming out of the riddle of his imagination, one discovers a renewal of feeling: an answer, for once.
