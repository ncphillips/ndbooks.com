The Sinistra Zone beging á la Chandler. But that's not how it continues. A finely wrought, postmodern feat of literary virtuosity; a chronicle of a bygone world. Again and again I was amazed by the fullness of the words, by the compact and luminous text – by the rich and powerful fabric that Ádám Bodor has woven into these pages.
