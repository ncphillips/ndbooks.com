\[Tzvetan\] Todorov praises the way Gary’s novels, unclouded by ideological intention and unfinching in the face of suffering, radiate colors at once “tragic” and “vibrant with joy and life.” Nowhere is Todorov’s praise truer than in Gary’s last novel, now appearing for the first time in English in the superb translation of Miranda Richmond Mouillot.
