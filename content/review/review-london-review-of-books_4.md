A moving document, a rapt exploration of a few more or less deconstructive ideas, a marvelous object of manufacture, a long trip through a short poem by Catullus, and a minor, memorable occurrence in the career of a major writer... Poetry of the most welcome kind: a work you can admire and interpret.
