*The She-Devil in the Mirror* is Horacio Castellanos Moya's funniest, darkest, most terrifying work. A 'typical' superficial telenovela-like Salvadoran upper-class heroine investigates her friend's murder and somehow her chattery, strenuously bright account of her adventure and her descent toward madness reveals more about intractable corruption, impunity and pure evil in her country than the usual narrators of such stories–terse, noirish, knowning detectives or journalists, for example–ever could.
