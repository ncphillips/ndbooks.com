*Man Tiger* and *Beauty Is a Wound* constitute a retort from the present to the dark times, while also acknowledging that the dark times may not yet be over. Against the killings of those years and the collective amnesia used to blank out the fate of the victims — a kind of second death, as it were — Kurniawan's fiction summons its legions of ghosts.
