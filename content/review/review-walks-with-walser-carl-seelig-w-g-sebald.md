That Walser is not today among the forgotten writers we owe primarily to the fact that Carl Seelig took up his cause. Without Seelig's accounts of the walks he took with Walser, without his preliminary work on the biography, without the selections from the work he published and the lengths he went to in securing the Nachlass—the writer's millions of illegible ciphers—Walser's rehabilitation could never have taken place, and his memory would in all probability have faded into oblivion.
