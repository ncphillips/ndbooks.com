From modernist poetry he has learned, as an essayist, about collage and the need for concision and exactitude. He has taken to heart poetics' fluid conflictions between the public and the personal, its conflation of the contemporary and the archaic, and its taste for the encyclopedic. Many of the essays from the first two books, *Works on Paper*and *Outside Stories*, are not essays as we know them, but rather dismantlements and explorations of the essay form.
