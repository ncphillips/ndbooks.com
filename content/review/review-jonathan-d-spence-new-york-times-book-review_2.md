Bonnie S. McDougall, an expert on modern Chinese literature and history, was one of the first Western scholars to see the brilliance of Bei Dao... Now the two volumes [The August Sleepwalker and Waves]... allow people who do not read Chinese to gauge the full range of Bei Dao's work and also to appreciate his hauntingly sad imagery. Bei Dao uses words as if he were fighting for his life with them.... In Waves... the form lets Bei Dao explore his own self and his own society with more leisure... his stories are almost unbearably poignant.
