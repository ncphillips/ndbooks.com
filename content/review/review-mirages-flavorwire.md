The first U.S. publication of Yousufi, who at 91 is quite possibly Pakistan’s most revered comedic writer. By way of a large volume of infinitely hilarious sketches, *Mirages of the Mind* tells the story of Indian Muslims who relocate to Pakistan — where Yousufi’s name is now synonymous with the very idea of literary humor.
