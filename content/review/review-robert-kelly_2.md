One of the things I find so striking in *A Book of Witness* is the resurgence, and I do mean surge, of the I, the acute ego-instrument that perceives, litmuses the world. How dissed and dismissed this tool has been in recent years, and how precisely Rothenberg deploys it now, forcing us to realize that witness happens in/to someone. This is something we've been struggling with for years, to keep the tool keen without dulling by biography, confession, concern. To invent the self anew each time is also, in a way of speaking, a witness. (Though I say that softly, so as not to weaken the force of witness.)
