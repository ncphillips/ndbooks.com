Mackey has now written close to one thousand pages of fiction about music that does not exist....What is so revolutionary about it, still, is the way Mackey makes the pain of this absence into the occasion for renewing a love of language, of redirecting our ears toward the page...[His] handling of history is subtle and immaculate.
