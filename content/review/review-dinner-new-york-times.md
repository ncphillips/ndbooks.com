It seems that the dead are rising from their graves on a “cadaverous march” — thousands of them feasting on the living in scenes of grisly violence. Since this is a novel by the wildly imaginative (and prolific) Argentine writer César Aira, that means that the outlandish plot turn will prove meaningful rather than gratuitous.
