What a delight to find seventeen of Saroyan's uncollected stories within one cover!... charming tales, all blessed with Saroyan's pixieish imagination and magical writing styleâ€¦ Even today they read as though they have been freshly minted from the Saroyan treasure house. A discovery for those who love Saroyan's fiction; his spark is still wonderfully alive.
