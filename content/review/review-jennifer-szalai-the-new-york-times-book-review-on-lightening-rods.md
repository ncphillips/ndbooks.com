The basic premise for *Lightning Rods* is so audacious that it might be hard to get past its general conceit, but its true brilliance lies in DeWittâ€™s careful deployment of language so common that we no longer see it. As any million-dollar litigation lawyer or two-cent literary critic will tell you, the devil is in the details.
