Joyce Cary has done it again! This astonishing man, this literary chameleon can, like a great actor, turn himself into absolutely anyone -- a Bohemian artist, a woman of easy virtue, a politician. He has only to imagine himself a certain character and he is that character -- talking, behaving as only that character could.
