Witness to the insanity of our wars, failures of imagination, betrayals, mass nightmare, she asks for nothing less than 'the world one world / dreaming together.' Her dream-singing is visionary and oracular but grounded in the body's hungers, the urge for life, and connection. Her masterful rhythms and pacing, her long cadences and gorgeous language, all ask to be read aloud.
