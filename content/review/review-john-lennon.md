The people that banned words in books didn't stop people from buying those books. If you couldn't buy Henry Miller in the early sixties, you could go to Paris or England. We used to go to Paris, and everybody would buy Henry Miller books because they were banned, and everybody saw them, all the students had them. I don't believe words can harm you.
