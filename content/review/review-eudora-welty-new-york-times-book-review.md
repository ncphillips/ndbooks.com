The land itself is a fantasy and a dream of strangeness. The physical pictures the author gives us are more than beautiful; they are wonderfully neat and often ironic .... *The Land of the Great Image* is a vivid, illuminating study written with the care and penetration that an artist as well as a historian must exercise to make the exotic past live and breathe for us.
