To great dramatic effect, Ohannessian saves the emotional punch of her story for the end, opening with a family idyll and ending with a tragedy... What makes her account, at once tragic and beautiful, stand out is that it has been carefully but unaffectedly sketched by an author who understand that much of life is beyond understanding.
