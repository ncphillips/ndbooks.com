Translated ingeniously by Will Kirkland and illustrated brilliantly by Maria Horvath. Incredibly, this is the first translation of these great little poem/songs.... Perfect, with the Spanish and English on facing pages. A child could almost learn English (or Spanish) from themâ€¦ as gifts for all children and poets, no age limit at either end.
