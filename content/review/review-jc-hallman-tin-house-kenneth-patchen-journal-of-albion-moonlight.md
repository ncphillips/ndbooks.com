With this particular book I attribute some degree of salvation. Let's get one thing straight: I'm not trying to tell you this is a great book. I'm not sure there is such a thing, and if there is, I'm not sure I'd argue this is one of them. But I am saying it's a pivotal book--both for me, and, in a way, for you.
