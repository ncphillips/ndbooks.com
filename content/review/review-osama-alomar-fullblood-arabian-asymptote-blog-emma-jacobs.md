The stories' distinctive flavour comes from Alomar's masterful shifts of character perspective within extremely tight parameters.â€¦The book is full of these moments which trip you up, swing bluntly from one psyche to another, rapidly decelerate time and play with scale, all of it exposing the delicate balance of our presumptions and allegiances; the small dictatorships that we foster second by second.
