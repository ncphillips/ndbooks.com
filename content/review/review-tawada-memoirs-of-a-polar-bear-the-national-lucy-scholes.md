Memoirs of a Polar Bear is a hauntingly strange concoction of dreamlike fantasy and factual­-based reality. A Kafkaesque exploration of the permeability between the human and the non-human, the self and the other, Yoko Tawada’s enchanting novel also addresses the timely issues of migration, citizenship and climate change.
