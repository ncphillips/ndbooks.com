Unbelievably, two-time Prix Goncourt winner Garyâ€™s luminous last work is only now appearing in English, but it was worth the wait... Gary uses limpid, accessible language (deftly translated) to deliver certain truths: memory can ground us or blind us; imagination, perhaps even a bit of craziness, is essential for survival; and we cannot easily be divided into heroes and villains. Smart and wonderfully life-affirming.
