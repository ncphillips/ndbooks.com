Over the years many of Carruth's poems have impressed me, sobered me, moved me. In all of them I find qualities I prize and rarely encounter. But what effects me most is the way these qualities combine, their drive toward wholeness––it's how the poet's moments of deep feeling arrive. I’ll say it crudely: they're gobbets rather than feelings, flesh and thought together, as if torn out, something raw. But not at all in the technical sense. It's as if a piece of music were to include the felt outcries of the musicians. These moments are so alive, so immediate, that I take their context to be their actual coming about, something unmediated and direct. The effect is tension, conflict, even harshness, getting ripe and opening into resolutions that are beautiful and exciting. I think there is a very human faith underlying this process, faith not only in art but in some sort of dialectic of error, pain and virtue, the tendency of the spirit to clarify itself.
