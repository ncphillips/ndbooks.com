Mr. Collis's lovely, exciting, vivid, romantic, and extremely witty story...is a tale of pure enchantment throughout, of the darkest possible deeds in the brightest possible sunlight, of palanquins, royal barges and State Umbrellas, of dancing girls and jugglers, of poisonings, burnings, and executions at the feet and trunks of trained elephants, of tortuous intrigues and calm metaphysical discussions.
