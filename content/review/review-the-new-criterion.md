The stories in this collection ... artfully echo Bioy Casares’s major achievement of 1940, exploring the obsessions implicit in the earlier masterpiece.... Bioy Casares is now Argentina’s most distinguished living man of letters and is considered a founding father of the new novel in all of Spanish America. When Carlos Fuentes noted that 'without Borges, there would be no new Spanish American novel,' he misspoke—he should have said “Biorges.”
