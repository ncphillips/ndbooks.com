In *The Ghost of Birds*, part of which is a continuation of the serial essay begun in *An Elemental Thing*, Eliot Weinberger further establishes himself as one of our singular and singularly great essayists. A modernist with the horror and absurdity of the 20th century behind him, Weinberger’s collection—which moves from medieval Irish legends to contemporary politics and poetry—is tinged humor and grace, fully alive to the weirdness of the world.
