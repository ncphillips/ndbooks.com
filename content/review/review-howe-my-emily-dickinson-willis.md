In the non-conformist tradition of William Carlos Williams''s *In the American Grain* and Charles Olson''s *Call Me Ishmael*, Susan Howe''s *My Emily Dickinson* reclaims the primacy of the poet''s voice in American literary criticism even as it redresses the troubling absence of women within those antecedents. In this groundbreaking and influential work, Howe explores Dickinson''s poems in all their radical indeterminacy and acoustical complexity, brilliantly revealing their explosive, modern power. *My Emily Dickinson* is visionary criticism at its best.
