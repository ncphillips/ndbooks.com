Here's my request [to New Directions]: give us something written on this side of the 20th century – after Argentina experienced its 2001 economic collapse ... I want to see Aira process a society unhinged and chaotic – you know, like ours is right now. My suggestion: *Shantytown*, an absurdist rending of life in a downtown Buenos Aires Hooverville.
