Seelig kindly visited Walser and started keeping a record of his opinions, creating over the course of time an indispensable document for all those who love Walser's surprising prose, which, silent as snowfall, cries out from the nothingness. Walser—as can be observed in Seelig's book—lectured on beer and twilight.
