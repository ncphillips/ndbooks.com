Hoffmann's is an exile literature in exile from itself: self-conscious, and humorously historicized, yet with none of its homage preserved obviously. In his pages, the oldest of folkish tropes are wryly revivified into a third literature, that of a new and Third Eastâ€“an undiscovered continent of exotically compelling fictions.
