Lyrical, poetic—but to call these paragraphs prose poems would be misleading. There is something necessarily prosaic about them. _The Book of Disquiet_ is caught up in the steady drumbeat of ordinary life and all its detritus: a favorite pair of boots, a type of pant that’s in fashion, the way people in Lisbon pronounce _Trás-os-Montes_, but most of all the ordinary noise of the self thinking about itself. Its pages, like Pessoa’s trunk, are thick with thoughts.
