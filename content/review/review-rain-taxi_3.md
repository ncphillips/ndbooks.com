Weinberger's anthology presents both the range of classical Chinese poetry and a catalogue of translations to compare and contrast... With such many-sided and multifaceted viewing, the reader ends up with a richer, more developed sense of the poems and their literary tradition... and of the Chinese poetry itself, as close to the original in spirit and in letters as any volume can hope to achieve.
