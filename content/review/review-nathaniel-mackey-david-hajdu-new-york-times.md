It feels, sentence to sentence and page to page, like a work in the act of being created. It is not simply writing about jazz.... There is a clich√© about music writing, sometimes attributed to Thelonious Monk, among others: 'Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.' If so, Nathaniel Mackey is compelled, rather than deterred, by the multiform madness of the enterprise. He is the Balanchine of the architecture dance.
