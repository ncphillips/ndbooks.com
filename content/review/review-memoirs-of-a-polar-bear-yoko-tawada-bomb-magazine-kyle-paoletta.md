Writing, for Tawada, is solaceâ€”the only way for us to do what the bears in this story do naturally is to pull together the pieces and express something innate we didn't know we had language for. *Memoirs*' great triumph is to literalize this process, to replace a metaphysical problem of expression with concrete representation.
