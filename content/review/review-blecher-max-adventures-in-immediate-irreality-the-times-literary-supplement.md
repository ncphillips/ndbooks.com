Blecher has often been compared to Kafka (and not without reason), but the strongest connection, however, is with Salvador Dali. Like Dali's 'soft clocks,' everything here is about to melt. It is as though Blecher's world is always on the verge of ontological collapse; from behind the veil of things, nothingness stares out at him.
