An American original... he stole time to create the most substantial one-man body of literature in our history. When he died at 79, he had no peer as the total American writer. His language rolled clean off the American tongue. His emotions were torn from the national consciousness, like a page from the morning paper. More than Robert Frost, perhaps more than Eliot, Williams shaped the present in American poetryâ€¦ his writing needs a million readers and this *Reader* is a great place to begin.
