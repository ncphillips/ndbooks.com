*Tres* is not just a Robert Bolaño masterpiece, it's another Bolaño masterpiece. . . . Bolaño's talent resides in his ability to transport the reader to the precipice of so many things, not the least of which is a euphoric whirlwind of delight. *Tres* is a beautiful book that transports the reader in many strange and wonderful ways.
