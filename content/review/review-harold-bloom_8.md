*The Maias* is one of the most impressive European novels of the nineteenth century, fully comparable to the most inspired novels of the great Russian, French, Italian and English masters of prose fiction. A family chronicle of intense historical insight and narrative power, *The Maias* reveals the decadence of Portugal in its long decline that was to culminate in the Salazar Fascist regime of the twentieth century. More than that, *The Maias* is a vision also of the general European malaise that eventually brought on the two World Wars and their aftermaths.
