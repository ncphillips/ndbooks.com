More than any other poet, Jonathan Williams has used the Objectivist principle, the idea that a poem is first of all a linguistic, phonetic, graphic object. He takes the language eroding right now in our mouths and cultivates it, shapes it, and speaks it to life. For Williams more than anyone I know, poetry is an active art, the language being spoken.
