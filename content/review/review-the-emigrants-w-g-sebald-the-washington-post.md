W. G. Sebald's [early death is] much lamented by admirers of his too few books, chiefly *The Emigrants*, *The Rings of Saturn*, *Vertigo*, and *Austerlitz*. Readers of these four essay-fictions know that Sebald exemplified the best kind of cosmopolitan literary intelligence - humane, digressive, deeply erudite, unassuming and tinged with melancholy. The last quality is particularly important, for if one had to characterize Sebald's ethos - the mood he generates on the page, the themes that haunt him - one could hardly do better than borrow the title of the famous essay by Freud: 'Mourning and Melancholy.'
