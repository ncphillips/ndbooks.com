The late eighteenth century is when modernity (more exactly, the modernities) began. Sterne, Diderot, Rousseau... among the effortlessly brilliant writers of that incandescent era, there still remains Xavier de Maistre to discover or rediscover. His masterpiece, Voyage Around My Room, is one of the most original and mettlesome autobiographical narratives ever written.
