Far from some modernist stunt, the form of the book dovetails beautifully with Johnson's subject––the accidental yet persistent nature of memory... This book, with no belief in God, no hope for heaven, makes you feel the stuff of life as sacred, and our inability to hold on to it as damnation enough for anyone to be made to bear.
