Fascinating ... [*The Garden of Departed Cats*] is an illuminating transitional work between the work of Turkey's romantic realist Yashar Kemal and contemporary postmodernist Orhan Pamuk. Very much the best book of Karasu's to have appeared in English translation (a splendidly lyrical one, incidentally). More please.
