Alain Dani√©lou is well-known to scholars in Oriental religion and linguistics. He is bound to become world famous as the author of a great autobiography, whose scenes and figures are of both the East and the West and whose psychology is conspicuously of our time. We are fortunate to have it in a faithful and eloquent translation.
