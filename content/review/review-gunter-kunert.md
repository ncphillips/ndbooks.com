In the poems of Kazuko Shiraishi East and West connect and unite fortuitously. In her poems, Japan and Europe have entered into an inseparable marriage. Something very special and unusual defines these poems. On the way to a world culture, to a comprehensive world literature, Kazuko Shiraishi's poetry marks one step. And it refutes Kipling's dictum that East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet. In Kazuko Shiraishi's poems this meeting has already happened.
