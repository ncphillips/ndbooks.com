Jerome Rothenberg is one of the truly contemporary American poets who has returned U.S. poetry to the mainstream of international modern literature. At the same time, he is a true autochthon. Only here and now could have produced him––a swinging orgy of Martin Buber, Marcel Duchamp, Gertrude Stein, and Sitting Bull.
