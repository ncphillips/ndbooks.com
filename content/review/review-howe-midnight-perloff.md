The germ of this extraordinary book is an elegy for the poet''s mother, the Irish actress and playwright Mary Manning. But in *The Midnight*, ''elegy'' resides in the space between verse and prose, word and image, text and textile, lyric and narrative, the everyday and the fantastic, Ireland and the United States. Susan Howe is our great poetic chronicler of what it means to dwell in possibility, to live on the *Edge*.
