Only a few, John Keene among them, in our age, authentically test the physics of fiction as both provocation and mastery. Continuing what reads like the story collection as freedom project, in *Counternarratives*, Keene opens swaths of history for readers to more than imagine but to manifest and live in the passionate language of conjure and ritual.
