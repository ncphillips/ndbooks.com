Reading *Between Parentheses* is not like sitting through an air-conditioned seminar with the distinguished Señor Bolaño. It's like sitting on a barstool next to him, the jukebox playing dirty flamenco, after he's consumed a platter of Pisco Sours. You may wish to make a batch yourself before you step onto the first page.
