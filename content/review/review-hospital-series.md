What Rosselli expresses in these texts – so skillfully transferred by Antagonini et al – is an often-wrenching *cri de coeur* situating a continuum of affectivity. Rosselli and her translators seem engaged in a “union/ of two souls one tarantella,” and these English-language versions move across vistas of love and despair and hope and insanity, in a dance toward newer orders of weird reckoning.
