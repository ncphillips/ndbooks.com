The incredible shrinking writer is a major twentieth-century prose artist who...can be placed in that comic tradition [that] runs form Gogol through Kafka and down to Jos√© Saramago...When Walser met Lenin in Zurich during the war, all he had to say was 'So you, too, like fruitcake?'...It is remarkable to see what variety and richness, what easiness and charm, what winsome inanities and philosophical depths he could pack into half a page.
