For years, Dickinson critics have been looking for some kind of order among the manuscripts - some way to describe or theorize the 'filing system' that the poet left and we found. In The Gorgeous Nothings, instead, what's restored to these traces of the work is a sense of occasioned disorder. What's been preserved through time in her handwriting is the decision to occupy the page. The page becomes just as important as the writing.
