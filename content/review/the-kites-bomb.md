_The Kites_ is indeed a treasure, capable of accessing an enormous node of insight and  almost-overwhelming beauty spliced with bittersweet candor. For Gary the novelist, it is not only love and fellow-feeling that unites us, but “the expression of suffering.” Perhaps it took the suffering that claimed Gary’s life for him to write as expansive a work of devout  humanism as _The Kites_. Whatever the case, we are lucky to have it at last. We’re going to need it.
