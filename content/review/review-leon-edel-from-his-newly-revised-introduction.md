The themes of this under-valued novel begin to disengage themselves: the ageing process, the invulnerability of art, indeed the 'madness of art,' which insists on seeing more than the immediate 'real,' and the vulnerability of love... Henry James's work had never dealt with love... Now, at the very last of the century... this was the new awareness, the new insight. He was vulnerable: he too could love.
