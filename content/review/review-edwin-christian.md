A House of Children is my favorite Cary novel. The organization––the progress of children toward maturity by means of sudden epiphanies––is remarkable. The characters, based on Cary's cousins and aunts and the author himself, are charming. The language is intoxication. No one writes more wisely about childhood than Joyce Cary. He remembers what most of us have forgotten.
