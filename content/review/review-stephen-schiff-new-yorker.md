Muriel Spark emerged thirty-six years ago with a spectacular first novel... The Comforters is fascinating: its heroine, Caroline Rose, is a recently converted Catholic who finds herself hallucinating voices––voices that indicated to her that she has become a character in a novel. And, of course, she has––the very novel we're reading.
