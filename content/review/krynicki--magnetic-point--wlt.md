Krynicki's crystalized poems resemble prayers. _Magnetic Point_ should be on the shelf of everyone interested not just in contemporary Polish poetry but also those who crave poems that work against the grain. Here we have a poet whose quietude rings truer than many a thundering pronouncement uttered in the service of this or that politics or aesthetics.
