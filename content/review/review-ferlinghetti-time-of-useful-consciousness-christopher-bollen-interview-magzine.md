Ferlinghetti refers to Ginsberg as 'the Whitman of our age,' but *Time of Useful Consciousness* has that epic, galvanizing, country-hopping voice of a latter-day Good Gray as Ferlinghetti recreates the pioneer spirit of racing west for gold, for freedom, for art, for land, for the hell of it, for life â€” as well as all the messy stops along the way.
