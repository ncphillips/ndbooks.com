I think what most delights is the insistently human scale, the oldtime Roman clarity of terms. But there is also that timeless intelligence of love's musing reflection, in whatever language impinges, or makes possible such ultimately human speech. In short, Laughlin a gentleman and a scholarâ€“and a poet of happily common places.
