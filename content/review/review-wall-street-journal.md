This is powerful but not comfortable reading, in the prose of a poet and the vision of a healer. I wish... all doctors could read it. He was a good man and a good poet, for both of which we, with Dr. Coles, 'as many in New Jersey had occasion to say during the first half of this century, say and say again: Thank you, Dr. Williams.'
