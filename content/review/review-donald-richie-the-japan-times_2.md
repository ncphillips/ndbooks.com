[Tsushima's heroines share a] hopeless, level gaze which sees everything, the ability (in spite of having seen everything) to go ahead, eyes on the road–it takes a very special and very personal talent to so convincingly display this....[And] here Tsushima has finally found something like perfection in this imperfect world–Geraldine Harcourt's translations. After the first page, one completely forgets that it is, indeed, a translation one is reading.
