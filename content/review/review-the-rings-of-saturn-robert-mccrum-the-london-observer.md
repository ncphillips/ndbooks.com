Ostensibly a record of a journey on foot through coastal East Anglia, *The Rings of Saturn* is also a brilliantly allusive study of England's imperial past and the nature of decline and fall, of loss and decay. *The Rings of Saturn* is exhilaratingly, you might say hypnotically, readable. It is hard to imagine a stranger or more compelling work.
