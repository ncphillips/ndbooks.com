What a poet! I have never seen grace and genius, a winged heart and a crystalline waterfall, come together in anyone else as they did in him. Federico Garc√≠a Lorca was the extravagant 'duende,' his was a magnetic joyfulness that generated a test for life in his heart and radiated it like a planet.
