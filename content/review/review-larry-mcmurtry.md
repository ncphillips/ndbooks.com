Carlton Lake’s Confessions is a charming memoir. It says much about the discipline, the passion, and the sheer good luck that go into the formation of a great book and manuscript collection. It opens for the curious the not easily penetrated world of the French rare book trade, in both its upper and lower reaches. Finally, it adds a wealth of detail to our knowledge of Eluard, Cocteau, Valery, Toulouse-Lautrec, and a number of lesser-known figures—for example, Henri-Pierre Roché, the author of Jules et Jim. Those who love book-trade intrigue will have to have it. So will all those who can’t resist a good story.
